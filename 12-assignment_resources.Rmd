Listed below are some helpful website, books, datasets and tools you might find useful.

## Markscheme

The markscheme can be found on Moodle with a break down of how much percent is given to each criteron. Read it closely **and often** when preparing for the final exam.

## Old practicals

The module has developed over several years and there is some content that we no longer cover but still exsits in old practical books, specifically:

* [interpolation](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo_20192020/rasters-descriptive-statistics-and-interpolation.html#part-3-interpolation) 
* [cross validation, Rigde, LASSO and elastic net regression](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo_20192020/advanced-r-maup-and-more-regression.html#regression-relationships)
* [Online mapping / Shiny basics](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo_20192020/online-mapping-descriptive-statistics.html#part-b-online-mapping)
* [Bootstrap resampling in regression](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo_20202021/gwr-and-spatially-lagged-regression.html#bootstrap-resampling)
* [Temperature analysis using Landsat data](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo_20212022/advanced-raster-analysis.html)

## Events / meet other spatial data professionals

The [UK ESRI conference](https://www.esriuk.com/en-gb/about/events/ac/overview) is normally free to go to and whilst (in my opinion) it's mostly just ESRI marketing their latest products it is good to go along and see how industry are using spatial software. It might also be useful for dissertation ideas / networking.

## Cool stuff to explore

New packages and functions that i've recently come across that are worth exploring..

If you want to produce more efficent R code then have a look at the [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html) book.

...that's a lot of books, should we read all of them? No, be selective, a lot of the same material will be covered in each book. Follow your interests, read widely and think about how you could apply these ideas / concepts to different topics or disciplines!

## New developments

Every year there is a useR conference that provides a load to tutorials on the latest developments and research...check them out here:
