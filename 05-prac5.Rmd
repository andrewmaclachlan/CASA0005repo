[Adam](https://open.spotify.com/album/6QcNw2Tt4KxraptfxcYzNy) Your ears are in for an absolute treat this week. Hospital Records have only gone and put out a mind-blowing mini compilation album which completely smashes it. It's NHS400 - get your ears around this!

## Introduction 

In this practical we're going to focus on creating mapped outputs in R. For fun we're going to use data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Airbnb. 

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{note}"}

Within this practical we show how to make maps in **just** R. We used to provide instructions for QGIS and these have been moved to the additional resources section. It is useful to have some knowledge of QGIS for your future career but it is not needed for the exam.

:::

### OSM

OpenStreetMap is collaborative project that has created a free editable map of the World. As users can create their own content it is classed as Volunteered geographic Information (VGI). There is a lot of academic literature on VGI, it's advnatages and disadvantages. For an overview of VGI checkout this [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y) by Goodchild (2007).

If you are interested in exploring the power of VGI and OSM further checkout [missing maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/). They aim to map missing places, often in less developed countires, using OSM so that when natural disasters occur first responders can make data informed decisions. They run events all over the world and it's worth going to meet other spatial professionals, gain some experience with OSM and contribute to a good cause. 

### Airbnb

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people looking to rent homes to those seeking accommodation often over short time periods.

## Data

It’s possible to download OSM data straight from the website, although the interface can be a little unreliable (it works better for small areas). There are, however, a number of websites that allow OSM data to be downloaded more easily and are directly linked to from the ‘Export’ option in OSM. Geofabrik (one of these websites) allows you to download frequently updated shapefiles for various global subdivisions.

### OSM

1. Go to the Geofabrik download server [website](http://download.geofabrik.de/)

1. Navigate to: Europe > United Kingdom > England > Greater London

1. Download greater-london-latest-free.shp.zip

1. Unzip the data and save it to your current folder

### London boroughs

We'll use our London boroughs layer again, either load it from week 1 or download it:

1. To get the data go to [the London data store](https://data.london.gov.uk/)

1. Search for Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London

1. Download the statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip

1. Unzip the data and save it to your current folder

### World cities

We will use World cities to provide some context to our maps.

1. Download them from the [ArcGIS HUB](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/6996f03a1b364dbab4008d99380370ed_0) > Download > Shapefile.

### Uk outline

1. Download [GADM data for the UK](https://gadm.org/download_country.html)

### Airbnb

1. Download the `listings.csv` from the [inside airbnb website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for London.

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{note}"}
In the lecture we discussed how when producing maps there should be some sort of common denominator as opposed to mapping raw counts. Go and source a suitable common denominator then using the skills from previous weeks normalise your data. **Hint** there is a table on the [Office for National Statistics NOMIS website](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/data_finder) called number of bedrooms which would let you normalise the airbnb and hotel data based on the number of bedrooms in each ward. 
:::

## Plan

Before we being, it's useful to draw out what we want our final map to look like otherwise you might find yourself drowning in code without a clear aim. Here, i want to compare airbnbs and hotels across London boroughs...

I've selected boroughs for ease and to show certain concepts:

* Boroughs are **not** a good spatial unit for this
* We should **never** use count data for mapping

I am going to make a few maps but the first one will resemble an academic figure where there will be sub-figures (e.g. A, B), a study area location map and a legend.

My drawing skills are very average, but something like this...

```{r fig.cap="Map plan", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("prac5_images/map_plan.png")
```

So...where do we begin

* Conceptually think of each section (A), (B) as a **separate** object. For example, my sub-figure (A) will be a London borough 'sf' object that has a column of Hotels. (B) will be the same but for Airbnbs. 

* We need to wrangle our data to get to that point, this will include:
 
  1. Downloading data:
  
  **For sub figures (A) and (B)**
  
    * London borough MSOAs (shp)
    * Airbnbs (csv)
    * Hotels (shp)
  
  **For the location map**  
  
    * Outline of the UK (shp)
    * UK cities (shp)

  2. Setting the CRS and filtering:
  
    * Our CRS for the Boroughs needs to be British national grid (BNG)
    * Filter hotels from the OSM data
    * Filter equivalent airbnbs (e.g. room_type == 'Entire home/apt' & availability_365 =='365')
    
  3. Joining and summing data
    * Join the Airbnbs to the MSOAs and sum (i.e. how many are in each MSOA)
    * Join the Hotels to the MSOAs and sum
    
  4. Making some maps.  
    

## CRS and filter 

We can start with our OSM and Airbnb data which we need for our sub figures...

* OSM
* Airbnb
* MSOAs

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)

# OSM data

OSM <- st_read("prac5_data/greater-london-latest-free.shp/gis_osm_pois_free_1.shp")%>%
  st_transform(., 27700) %>%
  #select hotels only
  filter(fclass == 'hotel')

# Airbnb data
Airbnb <- read_csv("prac5_data/listings.csv") %>%
  # longitude is considered x value here, latitude is y
  st_as_sf(., coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                   crs = 4326) %>%
    st_transform(., 27700)%>%
    #select entire places that are available all year
    filter(room_type == 'Entire home/apt' & availability_365 =='365')


#London Borough data is already in 277000
Londonborough <- st_read("Prac1_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp")%>%
  st_transform(., 27700)


```

Next, let's load the data needed for our study area map:

* World cities, filtering for Birmingham, London and Edinburgh 
* An outline of the UK

```{r, message=FALSE}

# load world cities
Worldcities <- st_read("prac5_data/World_Cities/World_Cities.shp") %>%
  st_transform(., 27700)

# filter based on key cities
Worldcities2 <- Worldcities %>%
  filter(CNTRY_NAME=='United Kingdom'&
           Worldcities$CITY_NAME=='Birmingham'|
           Worldcities$CITY_NAME=='London'|
           Worldcities$CITY_NAME=='Edinburgh')

# load UK outline
UK_outline <- st_read("prac5_data/gadm36_GBR_shp/gadm36_GBR_0.shp")%>%
  st_transform(., 27700)

```

## Join and sum

If we need to join two spatial features we can use a function called `st_join()`. 

This is similar to the the joins we explored with attribute data (e.g. joining based on a unique attribute column) but here the join field is actually the spatial unit. 

The output will be a large dataset where:

* Each hotel will be a new row
* It will retain the attributes of the hotel data but also append the attribute of the borough
* `st_join()` defaults to a left join, so in this case the borough data is the left dataset and all the right data has been appended to it. If the left data (borough) had no matches (so no hotels) they would still appear in the final dataset. The default argument for this is `st_intersects` but we will explore this more next week.

It is essentially working like this illustration, where the join field is actually the spatial boundaries of the borough - hence the term **spatial join**. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, fig.cap="dplyr::left_join() example with multiple matches. Source: [Tidy explain by Garrick Aden‑Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/)"}
knitr::include_graphics('prac2_images/left-join-extra.gif') 
```

Let's do the join

```{r, message=FALSE}

Hotels <-  st_join(Londonborough, OSM)

Airbnbs <-  st_join(Londonborough, Airbnb)

head(Hotels)

```

At the moment each hotel/airbnbs is a row and has the borough data appended. However what we actually want is a row per borough and the count of the number of hotels/airbnbs. We can do this using `group_by()`, which is always followed by `summarise()`:

* `group_by()` creates temporary groups, if you were to print the data it would look the same as before just with the number of groups specified
* `summarise()` takes the groups and provides a summary, here a count per group. 

```{r, message=FALSE}

Hotels_sum <- Hotels %>%
  # we need to list the columns we want to keep in the summarise
  group_by(., GSS_CODE, NAME)%>%
  # for each group count the number of rows and store in a column called accomodation count.
  summarise(`Accomodation count` = n())

Airbnb_sum <- Airbnbs %>%
  group_by(., GSS_CODE, NAME)%>%
  summarise(`Accomodation count` = n())
```

Look back at the left_join illustration and think about the `group_by()` and `summarise()` code. What result would be get if a borough had 0 hotels or airbnbs. For example in my data Sutton does not have any hotels or Airbnbs (note, OSM and Airbnbs are live datasets so it may have changed). 

A spatial join is like a left join. The Boroughs will always exist (there is always a row for Barking and Dagenham) and we have  grouped by and summarised the Borough (Barking and Dagenham). As it has a row it will return a value of 1, even through it is actually 0. To explore this let's filter our Hotels object (the one we spatially joined on Barking and Dagenham). Then compare it to the Hotel sum data...

```{r}
# the st_join data = 0 Hotels
Hotels %>%
  filter(NAME=="Barking and Dagenham")

# the group by and summarise data = 1 Hotel!
Hotels_sum %>%
  filter(NAME=="Barking and Dagenham")

```

So how do we fix this?

We can use a topological relationship. Here, the  first data set (A) dictates the length (e.g. first data set boroughs then 33 rows returned)


There are [many to choose from, here each tick denotes the relations that apply to the polygons. Note, that in several cases multiple topological relations would work.](http://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/spatial_relationships.html):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, fig.cap="Topological relations between vector geometries. Source: [Lovelace et al. 2022](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html)"}
knitr::include_graphics('prac6_images/relations-1.png') 
```

Common ones to focus on include:
  * `st_intersects(A, B)` - Do A (boroughs) touch or overlap with B (OSM).
    * Returns a list of boroughs (33 rows) and in each borough a list of hotels
  * `st_contains(A, B)` - Does A (boroughs) contain B (OSM)
    * Returns a list of boroughs (33 rows) and in each borough a list of hotels
  * `st_within(A, B)` - Is A (boroughs) inside B (OSM). This is asking are boroughs inside hotels
    * Returns a list of boroughs that are inside hotels, this produces a result of 0. If we flip it we get a result but it will be the length of the hotels (e.g. `st_within(OSM, Londonborough)`). Note, `st_within(A, B)  ==  st_contains(B, A)`

```{r}
Hotels_example <-st_contains(Londonborough, OSM)

Hotels_example
```
The result is 33 rows! If you have used a graphic user interface GIS before, this is the same as `select by location` (e.g. [select by location in QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/vectorselection.html#select-by-location)), and as using filter from `dplyr` is the same as `select by attribute`. 

* Now, we take the length of that list per borough.

```{r}
Accomodation_contained <- Londonborough%>%
  mutate(hotels_n = lengths(st_contains(., OSM)))%>%
  mutate(airbnbs_n = lengths(st_contains(., Airbnbs)))
```

Let's check our example of Barking and Dagenham, it should be 0 hotels **not** 1.

```{r}
# the group by and summarise data = 1 Hotel!
Accomodation_contained %>%
  filter(NAME=="Barking and Dagenham")
```

### Key advice

When to use `st_join()` or a topological relationship 

**`st_join()`**

  * joins attributes of two spatial objects e.g. if i wanted to know what borough each hotel was in...the output here would be points (as the first dataset is point)
```{r}
Hotels2 <-  st_join(OSM, Londonborough)
```
  
  * It can easily join polygons or points of the same exact geometry (e.g. if i had data in two sf objects for London)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
London_data <-  st_join(London_borough_data1, London_borough_data2, join=st_equals)
```

**topological relationships**

  * Create counts of points in polygons but without knowing what borough each hotel is in. It returns the borough polygons with a count.

## Mapping 

### tmap syntax

Ok, let's map! There are several mapping packages in R, the most popular being `tmap` (thematic map) and `ggplot2` which now can deal with `sf` objects through `geom_sf`. However we will focus on `tmap` as it is a dedicated spatial mapping package. In 2025 `tmap` transitioned from version 3 to 4. They are similar and if you use version 3 code a helper will provide suggestions for version 4. Version 4 has more options for displaying data and selecting colours. 

When installing `tmap` make sure to install the development version: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("r-tmap/tmap")
```

Go back to my original map plan drawing. Think of each section (A), (B), study area and legend as a quadrant. For each quadrant we need to make an object...Our first object for mapping hotels is below. 

`tmap` works on the principle of:

* loading your shape object with `tm_shape()` (here `sf` object, but it could be a raster)
* setting the map layer (e.g. polygons (`tm_polygons()`), symbols (`tm_symbols()`),raster (`tm_raster()`), text (`tm_text()`), lines (`tm_lines()`) etc).
* applying a derived function (e.g. border (`tm_borders()`), fill (`tm_fill()`), markers (`tm_markers()`).

See the [tmap guide for a full table of these](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/layers.html)

For example...

```{r}
library(tmap)

# change to "view" for an interactive map
tmap_mode("plot")

# set the shape
tm1 <- tm_shape(Accomodation_contained) + 
  # set the map layer
  # try changing this to tm_symbols()
  tm_polygons("hotels_n",
              col = "black", lwd=0.5, lty="dashed",)

# plot the map
tm1
```

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{note}"}

Here, where we have map layer (e.g `tm_polyons()`) the *derived function (e.g. border colour)* is within the map layer function.if we didn't have the map layer and just wanted to borders...

::: 

```{r}
tm_no_map_layer <- tm_shape(Accomodation_contained) + 
  # there is no tm_polygons() if we just want the map with no spatial data
  tm_borders(col = "darkblue")

tm_no_map_layer
```

Let's add in some more information to our map.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

# plot each map
tm1 <- tm_shape(Accomodation_contained) + 
  tm_polygons(fill ="hotels_n",
              col = "black", 
              lwd =0.5,
              lty="dashed",
              fill.chart = tm_chart_violin(),
              # above this was the same as before
              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(
                values="brewer.bu_pu",
                n=5,
                style="jenks"))

tm1
```

In the above code we have:

* `tm_scale_intervals()` - used for numerical data
* `values` - the values to use to style the map, here it's blue from the colour brewer list. There are a number of options here. See the next code chunk.
* `n` - the number of breaks to have
* `style` - how to decide where to make the breaks. We have a lot of choice for this. See the [interval scale reference](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/reference/tm_scale_intervals.html). Jenks looks for the *natural breaks* in the data and is often used.
* `fill_chart()` produces a summary of the mapped data with a violin plot, there are many options see the [tmap chart vigette](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/basics_charts)

To see all available colour options run the following code. Find an appropriate colour scheme and use the `name` in the `values` argument in the code above (replacing `brewer.bu_pu`)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(colorblindcheck)
cols4all::c4a_gui()

```
### Complete map

Before we progress we need to set up our breaks to be consistent across the two datasets, otherwise our maps will not be comparable. First of all let's see which dataset has the greatest range

```{r}
stats <- Accomodation_contained %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  dplyr::select(hotels_n, airbnbs_n) %>%  
  summarise(across(everything(), list(
    min = min,
    max = max,
    mean = mean,
    median = median,
    sd = sd
  )))
```


As the Airbnbs have the greatest range we will use that to generate our breaks and apply them to both datasets.

```{r}
library(classInt)

# Get Jenks breaks for 5 classes
breaks <- Accomodation_contained%>%
  st_drop_geometry()%>%
  #need a numeric vector not a dataframe or tibble
  pull(airbnbs_n) %>%             
  classIntervals(., n = 5, style = "jenks")
  
breaks$brks
```


Not let's make the maps for Hotels and Airbnbs as per the original plan. Because we have our data of interest in two separate we have a few options:

1. Make a `tmap` object for each dataset (i.e. the same as above but now for airbnb)
2. Use a facet map - this allows small maps for each group (here the group is airbnb or hotel)

Let's set up the facets..

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

tm1 <- tm_shape(Accomodation_contained) +
    tm_polygons(
      fill = c("hotels_n", "airbnbs_n"),
      fill.scale = list(tm_scale_intervals(values = "brewer.blues", breaks=breaks$brks)),
      # set the legend
      fill.legend = tm_legend(title="Accomodation count",
                              title.size=0.85,
                              size=0.8,
                              # plot outside of the main map
                              #explained below
                              position=tm_pos_out("right", 
                                                  "center",
                                                  pos.v = "center")),
      # all facets share the same legend
      fill.free = FALSE)+
  # make 2 rows for the facets
  tm_facets(nrow=2)

tm1
```

Here, we've set the position of the legend to be outside the main plot `tm_pos_out()` the arguments that follow set where to place the legend:

* right = in the area to the right side of the plot (each map is a 3x3 grid or possible area)
* center = in the center of the right "column"
* bottom = at the bottom of the right "column"

The vertical (`pos.v`) and horizontal (`pos.h`) positions can also be set numerically where in relation to the top left hand corner of the object you are placing. 

0 = left (`pos.h`) or bottom (`pos.v`)
1 = right (`pos.h`) or top (`pos.v`)

See the [tmap position guide for more information and examples](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/adv_positions#shortcut-method-inside-the-map-frame)

::: {.infobox .warning data-latex="{note}"}
Note, if we include a chart here it will combine the data into a single plot. So we could either:

* separate out our facets into individual tmap objects with a chart
* make separate charts with ggplot2 and add them onto the map as objects later.

:::

For now, we need to:

* Change the labels (`tm_layout()`)
* Add a compass (`tm_compass()`)
* Add a scalebar (`tm_scalebar()`)
* Add a credit to OSM/Airbnb (`tm_credits()`)

**Note**, when writing this practical i found an issue with the new version of tmap that meant the third item would not plot. See my [minimal worked example](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap/issues/1140#issuecomment-2980198902) on the issue tab.

Then we can save the map (`tm_save()`). When making position adjustments always check the saved version as this will differ to what you see in R.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

  # change headings or remove

tm2 <- tm1+
  tm_layout(panel.labels=c("Hotels", "Airbnb"),
            panel.show = TRUE,
           # panel.label.bg.color = "transparent",
            panel.frame = FALSE)+
  
  tm_compass(type= "arrow",
            size=1.8, 
            position = tm_pos_out("right", 
                                  "center",
                                  pos.h= -0.05,
                                  pos.v =0.7))+

                                    pos.v = 0.66))+
  # we could use tm_credits to place sub-titles like (A) or (B)
  # on the map.
  tm_credits("(c) OpenStreetMap contrbutors and Air b n b",
             size=0.6,
             position = tm_pos_out("center",

#### Study area

We want to add an "inset" map for our study area - this is just a map **on** our map

If we do a quick thematic map (`qtm()`) of our study outline we see that Scottish islands make it appear off centre. We use a *bounding box* to clip (cookie cutter) or shape.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width="800pt"}
qtm(UK_outline)
```

Go to www.bboxfiner.com

* On the left hand side you can select your CRS (here, British national grid, 27700). This will **load a new tab at the bottom** (like tabs in a spreadsheet)
* Click on the 27700 tab, draw a box and copy the coordinates
* Use *`st_crop()`* to clip the UK geometry to our box.

```{r}
newbb <- c(xmin=-296000, ymin=5408, xmax=655696, ymax=1000000)
  
UK_outlinecrop <- UK_outline$geometry %>%
  st_crop(., newbb)
```

To add layers to an individual map we **add** another geometry, here we have out UK outline (`tm_polygons`) then **add** our cities (`tm_symbols`) **on top of the polygons**.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", cache=FALSE}
tm3 <- tm_shape(UK_outlinecrop)+ 
  tm_polygons(col="darkslategray1")+
    tm_layout(frame=FALSE)+
  tm_shape(Worldcities2) +
    #adds the city points
    tm_symbols(shape=20,
               fill = "orange",
               #outline colour
               col="black",
               size=0.8)+
        #add the city labels, x and y move the label around the point
    tm_text("CITY_NAME", xmod=-1, ymod=-0.5)

```

We can also add a visual grey bounding box to our study area map. This is optional...

```{r}

# st_bbox gives the bounding x and y coordinates 
Londonbb <- st_bbox(Accomodation_contained,
                    crs = st_crs(Accomodation_contained))%>%
# st_as_sfc coverts the coordinates to an sf object
  st_as_sfc()

tm4 <- tm3 +
  tm_shape(Londonbb)+ 
  tm_borders(col = "grey40", lwd = 3)+
    tm_layout(frame=FALSE,
            bg.color = "transparent")
```


We can arrange our maps with a number of tools:

1. `tmap_arrange()` this is fairly simply but doesn't give much control over **placement** (e.g. `tmap_arrange(tm1, tm2)`)

We will focus on:

2. `tm_inset()` function. However, at the moment `tm_inset()` does not work with a tmap object. Instead we can take an image of our inset map with `tm_grob()` but we have a little less control with placement. See 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", cache=FALSE}

inset <- tmap_grob(tm4, asp=1.1)

final_map<- tm2+
  tm_inset(inset,
	         position = tm_pos_out("right", "center"))
tmap_save(final_map, "prac5_data/2_facet.png", width = 8, height = 6, units="in", dpi = 300)

```

3. the `grid` package. Again, can be used in a simple way but also permits re-location of the objects. However, once we use the `grid` package we can't export through tmap (e.g. `tmap_save(tm, filename = "mymap.png"`)

As i noted earlier i could also add a violin plot as an inset object...to enable a group function on our violin plot - meaning a violin plot for both hotels and airbnb we need to make our data long...

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

accom_long <- Accomodation_contained %>%
  # drop geometry for plotting
  st_drop_geometry() %>%  
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(hotels_n, airbnbs_n),
    names_to = "accom_type",
    values_to = "count"
  )

```

Next we use that object (`accom_long`) to make the plot

```{r}

violin <- accom_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = accom_type, y = count, fill = accom_type)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, color = "grey30", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(
    title = "",
    x = "",
    y = "",
    fill = "black"
  ) +
  # change the labels from the column names to..
scale_x_discrete(labels = c("hotels_n" = "Hotels", "airbnbs_n" = "Airbnbs"))+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)+
  theme(
    # no legend
    legend.position = "none",
    # all text to black
    text = element_text(color = "black"),         # set all text to black
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),    # axis tick labels
    axis.title = element_text(color = "black"),   # axis titles (if used)
    plot.title = element_text(color = "black")    # title (if used)
  )
```

Here is the grid package, we:

* plot our map (`tm2`)
* then "print" over the study area map and violin plot with the x and y controlling placement on the page.
* save the plot by 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "800pt", cache=FALSE}
library(grid)

# Open PNG device
png("prac5_data/3_facet.png", width = 8, height = 6, units="in", res = 300)

tm2
print(tm4, vp = viewport(x=0.68, y= 0.25, width = 0.3, height = 0.35))
print(violin, vp = viewport(x=0.67, y= 0.83, width = 0.25, height = 0.35))


# Close device
dev.off()
```

## Bad maps

Things to avoid:

* Poor labeling --- don't present something as an output with the file name (e.g. layer_1_osm) in the legend --- name your layers properly, it's **really easy** to do and makes a **big** difference to the quality of the map.
* No legend
* Screenshot of the map --- export it properly, we've been doing this a while and can tell
* Change the values in the legend ... what is aesthetically more pleasing 31.99999 or 32?. Make it as easy as possible to interpret your map.
* Too much data presented on one map --- be selective or plot multiple maps
* Presented data is too small or too big --- be critical about what you produce, it should be easy to read and understand
* A map or figure without enough detail --- **A reader should be able to understand a map or figure using the graphic in the figure/map and the caption alone!** A long caption is **fine** assuming it's all relevant information.

Another decent resource is the [Fundamentals of Data Visualization book](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)

That's the end of the practical! If you'd like to see how to make an interactive map then some guidance has been given in the Extras section, although this is not required.
