Hello <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="general_images/casa_logo.jpg" width="120" alt="CASA0005 course" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" /></a> and a warm welcome to the CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science online practical handbook. 

The buzzword ‘Big data’ and associated roles of data scientists have become common additions to academia, industry and government organisations seeking to optimise workflows and base decisions on factual evidence [@Donoho2017; @Li2016]. In response, the demand for data scientists has significantly grown, with two major recruitment websites LinkedIn and Glassdoor reporting a respective 56% and 44% year on year increase in advertised roles along with classification as the most promising career based on salary, growth, promotion opportunities and satisfaction within the USA in 2019 [@Glassdoor2020; @Pattabiraman2019]. In a similar theme data from the UK’s Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) shows that the number of postgraduate level data science courses within the UK has grown from 104 across 51 institutions to 195 across 85 institutions between the academic years commencing in 2019 and 2020 [@TheUniversitiesandCollegesAdmissionsService2020].

Whilst materials such as the R for Data Science book provide a foundational and essential resource for learning the R data science programming language, consideration of spatial data is extremely limited [@Grolemund2017]. The welcome addition of Geocomputation with R specifically addressed this resource gap, but often used basic examples that are unrepresentative of the complex spatial data wrangling, transformation and manipulation skills required by masters level graduates [@Lovelace2019]. Consequently, this content presents an academic teaching resource using applied real world government (e.g. [@Cosh2020]) and academic examples (e.g. [@Guha2018]) manipulating complex and large datasets in creating reproducible and actionable outputs, being made possible through delivery as a taught masters level module.
