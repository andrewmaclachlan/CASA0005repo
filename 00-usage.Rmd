## How to adopt this course {-}

Not all data used within the practicals is distributed on GitHub due to size limitations. Each practical describe how to access the datasets used within.

There are two main options to adopt this course:

1. Adopt the course in its entirety:
  + Install R and RStudio
  + Clone the project from GitHub to RStudio (in RStudio, File > New Project > Version Control > Git)
  + Install the  `renv` package and install all packages within the project using `renv::restore()`. On the project's GitHub the `renv.lock` file contains all of the packages (and versions) used within it.  
  + If you wish to build the book at any point, practicals (RMarkdown files) without data can be removed by commenting out the file (with a #) in the `_bookdown.yml` file.
  
For more details on how to use Git, GitHub and `renv` see the practical [Git, GitHub and RMarkdown]

2. Adopt a single practical by downloading the `.rmd` file, packages loaded within the `.rmd` file and associated data from the links listed within it.  

## How to contribute {-}

We welcome contributions to the material either directly, for any small issues or errors (e.g. typos) or through a GitHub issue for larger issues (e.g. further explanation requests, bugs in the code)

**For smaller issues** click the <i class ="fa fa-edit fa-lg"></i> button in the top tool bar: 

* Create a fork of the repository and clone it to your local computer
* Create a local branch 
* Make changes to that branch (commit them)

## Packages {-}

This bookdown document was built with:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(devtools)
library(DT)

# needed because new_session is set to true in _bookdown.yml
all_pkgs <- renv::dependencies(path = "DESCRIPTION") %>% 
  pull(Package) 

session <- devtools::session_info(pkgs = all_pkgs)

session$platform
```

And makes use of the following packages throughout. Thanks to [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/index.html#other-contributors) for this code.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
session$packages %>% 
  dplyr::select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = nrow(session$packages), 
                           autoWidth = TRUE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = FALSE))
```
