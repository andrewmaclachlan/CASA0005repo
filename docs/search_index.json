This website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. Data used within the practicals is available online, however occasionally websites can undergo maintenance or be inaccessible due to political factors such as government shutdowns. Accessing this data is explained in the section hello GIS.

Assignment resources Reading list", " Hello GIS Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships. However, at times it can be difficult to work with. You will get lots of error messages and have software crash. The academic staff are here to help you work through these practicals but we do not know everything. Its a good idea to become familar with online sources of help, such as: Stack Exchange RStudio community QGIS documemtation R documentation ArcGIS help pages Want to see what you can do with spatial analysischeck out this Whats Next video produced for the ESRI conference Intended course learning outcomes After having taking this module, you should be able to: Develop a working knowledge of QGIS and R to support the application of GI Science techniques Visualise geographic information through producing appropriate maps to high cartographic standards Carry out spatial data management tasks (joining attribute to geometry data, cleaning data, converting between file formats and spatial reference systems) Interpret data and apply relevant spatial analyses (e.g. auto correlation/hot spot analysis, areal interpolation, point in polygon/buffer analysis, spatial statistical analysis) to answer a variety of spatial problems Explain and evaluate common issues with geographic data such as representation and uncertainty Apply and critique (spatial) statistical analysis techniques to infer relationships between spatial phenomena Experience the diversity of the global spatial data landscape and evaluate the relative drawbacks and merits of different spatial datasets There is a lot of information within this practical book and we do not expect you to read everything we link to. You should attend each lecture, go through every practical and do some associated reading. This is a 15 credit module, equivalent to 150 hours of study (including the taught sessions). Outside of our lectures and practical sessions (3 hours a week) you should be spending an extra 12 hours a week on this module. How to use this book To get the most out of this book spend a few minutes learning how to control it, in the top right of this webpage you will see this tools bar: From left to right these buttons will let you: control the side bar search the entire book for a specific word change the text size, font, colour propose an edit if you see a mistake that I can review view the webpage in the raw RMarkdown format, we cover RMarkdown in the course information about shortcuts for this book and most others like it In addition the icon in the top right of the page takes you to the GitHub repository for this book, we cover GitHub in the course, but its basically where the online files for the book are stored. Getting started One of the issues with GIS is that many of the files we will be working with are quite large. Fortunately in recent years UCL has seriously beefed up the storage available for students. You now get 100GB of free storage, which should be plenty for the work you will be doing this year! The Bartlett faculty has several gigabytes of storage space available on their central servers, so before we get started, we will connect to our N drive to carry out all of our practical work over the coming weeks. The data we use in this practical book is representative of what you will find when conducting independent analysis. Some books and website will give you perfectly clean and ready to use data, we have not done this on purpose as its very important to master data wrangling (also called data manipulation). In the real world data is messy and its vital you know how to deal with it. Take this quote from the New York Times for example Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend from 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in this more mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets. How to download data and files from GitHub The majority of data required for the workshops is found online and we detail how to download this within the workshops. On occasion you may need to get some data from my GitHub, the workshops will instruct you to do this where needed. To do so you have a few options. Option 1 will let you download just a spceific folder whilst option 2 will download everything i have used to make the workshops. Option 1 Use DownGit Go to: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home Head over to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo Select a folder you wish to download  here ill use practical data as the example, click into the folder (prac7_data) and copy the url: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo/tree/master/prac7_data Paste it into DownGit and click Download, once downloaded then unzip the folder. Option 2 Go to the online repository page here: https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo Click Clone or download, the download as ZIP. This will download the everything i have used to make this website including all the data for the practicals Self guided learning The lectures and practicals of this course only form a part of the learning process. You are expected to undertake wider reading and explore new methods and approaches. We have provided guidance on useful resources throughout the course to use as a starting point but you are encouraged to go beyond our recommedations and fully engage with applied GIS research, methods and visualisation techniques. If you find a practical particularly easy or straightforward then please move on to the next one. Practicals that look at analytical relationships also have extension activities for you to try. Interactive lectures During the lectures we will be using an interative polling and Q&amp;A application called vevox. Its very simple to use, you can either: Download the app on iOS or Android: http://get.vevox.app Use the web app: https://vevox.app/ The meeting ID we will use is: 186-395-009 More help If you need specific assistance with this course please: Check the Moodle assessment tab for queries relating to assignments / deadlines. There is also an expected assignment timeline and frequently asked questions section within the assessment outline document. Speak to a member of the teaching team in the computer lab sessions Ask a question at the end of a lecture (time permitting) Ask a question on slack under the GIS channel you should have recevied an invite email from Steve Gray otherwise use this link. The teaching team will monitor this  use the #gis channel for this course. Due to the size of the class we will only reply to messages on slack so all students can see the discussion. If you have a personal matter in relation to completing the course then please speak to or email Andy or Adam. If you are struggling to use R dont worryhere is some advice from a tweet and interview with Hadley Wickham, chief scientist at RStudio You're doing it right if you get frustrated: if you're not frustrated, you're (probably) not stretching yourself mentally  Hadley Wickham ((???)) 11. Februar 2015 Its easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, Oh its me, Im really stupid, or, Im not made out to program. But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. Its just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Dont blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. You can also go through other free resources including: Free RStudio Education resources Codeacademy YaRrr! The Pirates Guide to R At the end of every practical there is a link anonymous Google feeback form, let us know if something is unclear and we will go over it in a future session. If after pursuing all these avenues you still need help you can book into our office hours. These meetings are to discuss a geographical concept in relation to the material/assessment or for any personal matters relevant to the completion of the module. These meetings are not to be used for specific technical issues. Problems of this nature should be addressed in the practical sessions. Andy Adam If you give us minimal information in this form (e.g. one word) we will cancel the meeting. Noticed a mistake? No one is perfect, if you notice a mistake let us know through the GitHub issues tab Dont worry if you are unsure about what GitHub is we cover it in the course. Assignment resources Want some tips for resources on your assignment?. head over to the Assignment resources pages Reading list We link to books and resources throughout each practical and in the Assignment resources pages, but a full reading list for the course is provided on the UCL library reading list page for the course, there is also a link to it over on Moodle. Weve tried to mostly recommend open source and free books, any others are available from the library. "],["software-installation.html", "Software installation QGIS R ArcGIS", " Software installation This course primarily uses the R data science programming language and we strongly advise you complete the assignment using it. We briefly touch upon QGIS to give you a basic foundation in the range of spatial software available, please follow the instructions below before the first practical session to install the software on your local computer if you are planning to use it throughout the course. QGIS QGIS is an open-source garphic user interface GIS with many community developed add on packages that (or plugins) that provide additional functionality to the software. To get QGIS on your personal machine go to: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html I install the OSGeo4W version. The nature of open-source means that several programs will rely on each other for features. OSGeo4W tracks all the shared requirements and does not install any duplicates. R R is both a programming language and software environment, originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. Rs great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. Setup 1 Search for and open RStudio. You can install R Studio on your own machine from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download R studio requires R which you can download from: https://cran.rstudio.com/ RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R  it makes R much easier to use. If you are using a Mac and run into issues, firstly follow the instructions below then check out the Mac R issues section if the problem persists. Setup 2 UCL students (and staff) can now also make use of R Studio Server. Its RStudio on a webpage, so no installation is required. Access information will be provided on Moodle and in the lectures. ArcGIS As ArcGIS is not open soure and from my experience analysis within it is largely not reproducible and therefore it is not included within this practical book. If you are interested in it please consult previous iterations of this course. You will find tutorials on: Joining data, Map Making and Spatial Patterns. However, the analysis for your coursework must be done in either R and/or QGIS.

Feel free to follow your own GIS interests, but good places to start include the following: Assignment This week you should undertake wider data exploration and reading to find a topic you might be interested in progressing with. Start with a data search first to avoid proposing a research area then forcing potentially unsuitable data to fit it. Reading Each week ill provide a core chapter to support the skills taught here. However, you are free to read whatever interests you and Adam and I strongly encourage this, so please dont be constrained to this recommendation. Consult the reading list, practical and lecture each week for more ideas. This week: Chapter 2 Geographic data in R from Geocomputation with R by Lovelace, Nowosad and Muenchow (2020). Opening practice: supporting reproducibility and critical spatial data science by Brunsdon and Comber (2020) Watching What is Spatial Data Science from some of our friends at CARTO 1.3 Recommended listening  Some of these practicals are long, take regular breaks and have a listen to some of our fav tunes each week. Andy. Week 1. No other choice than Vampire Weekend. The band formed during college (University in the USA) and produced their first album of their own whilst working full time jobs! Incredible. The lead vocalist and guitarist Ezra Koenig was a school teacher in Brooklyn, New York. Ive seen them a few times at Glastonbuty and in London during which they gave the people what they wanted and took requests from their entire catalogue, really amazing musicians. Note some of the guest appearances in this album as they also might make an apperance later in the term! Adam OK, its week 1, so Im going in HARD. This week its the ravers raver, the DJs DJ. This man is a style icon and so drum &amp; bass it hurts - its Voltage! Here he is with his new album, Balance Over Symmetry. This will surprise a lot of people as its an eclectic mix of DnB bangers through to some Burial-inspired minimal dubstep. Follow him on Instagram and get your ears around his brilliant. 1.4 The Basics of Geographic Information Geographic data, geospatial data or geographic information is data that identifies the location of features on Earth. There are two main types of data which are used in GIS applications to represent the real world. Vectors that are composed of points, lines and polygons and rasters that are grids of cells with individual values In the above example the features in the real world (e.g. lake, forest, marsh and grassland) have been represented by points, lines and polygons (vector) or discrete grid cells (raster) of a certain size (e.g. 1 x 1m) specifying land cover type. 1.4.1 Data types in statistics Before we go any further lets just quick go over the different types of data you might encounter Continuous data can be measured on some sort of scale and can have any value on it such as height and weight. Discrete data have finite values. It can be numeric such as number of shoes or categorial such as positive or negative. Foot length would be continuous data but shoe size would be discrete data. Nominal data has labels without any quantitative value such as hair colour or type of animal. Ordinal data has an order or scale, for example if you have ever seen the chilli rating system on food labels or filled a happiness survey with a range between 1 and 10  thats ordinal. Here the order matters, but not the difference between them. Binary data is that that can have only two possible outcomes, yes and no or shark and not shark. 1.4.2 Important GIS data formats There are a number of commonly used geographic data formats that store vector and raster data that you will come across during this course and its important to understand what they are, how they represent data and how you can use them. 1.4.2.1 Shapefiles Perhaps the most commonly used GIS data format is the shapefile. Shapefiles were developed by ESRI, one of the first and now certainly the largest commercial GIS company in the world. Despite being developed by a commercial company, they are mostly an open format and can be used (read and written) by a host of GIS Software applications. A shapefile is actually a collection of files  at least three of which are needed for the shapefile to be displayed by GIS software. They are: .shp - the file which contains the feature geometry .shx - an index file which stores the position of the feature IDs in the .shp file .dbf - the file that stores all of the attribute information associated with the coordinates  this might be the name of the shape or some other information associated with the feature .prj - the file which contains all of the coordinate system information (the location of the shape on Earths surface). Data can be displayed without a projection, but the .prj file allows software to display the data correctly where data with different projections might be being used On Twitter and want to see the love for shapefiles.have a look at the shapefile account 1.4.2.2 GeoJSON GeoJSON Geospatial Data Interchange format for JavaScript Object Notation is becoming an increasingly popular spatial data format, particularly for web-based mapping as it is based on JavaScript Object Notation. Unlike a shapefile in a GeoJSON, the attributes, boundaries and projection information are all contained in the same file. 1.4.2.3 Shapefile and GeoJSON Were now going to explore a shapefile (.shp ) and GeoJSON (.geojson) in action. Go to: http://geojson.io/#map=16/51.5247/-0.1339 Using the drawing tools to the right of the map window, create 3 objects: a point, line and a polygon as I have done above. Click on your polygon and colour it red and colour your point green Using the Save option at the top of the map, save two copies of your new data  one in .geojson format and one in .shp format Open your two newly saved files in a text editor such as notepad or notepad++. For the shapefile you might have to unzip the folder then open each file individually. What do you notice about the similarities or differences between the two ways that the data are encoded? 1.4.2.4 Raster data Most raster data is now provided in GeoTIFF (.tiff) format, which stands for Geostarionary Earth Orbit Tagged Image File. The GeoTIFF data format was created by NASA and is a standard public domain format. All necesary information to establish the location of the data on Earths surface is embedded into the image. This includes: map projection, coordinate system, ellipsoid and datum type. 1.4.2.5 Other data formats Aforementioned data types and formats are likely to be the ones you predominately encounter. However there are several more used within spatial analysis. These include: Vector GML (Geography Markup Language  gave birth to Keyhold Markup Language (KML)) Raster Band SeQuential (BSQ) - technically a method for encoding data but commonly referred to as BSQ. Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) Arc Grid There are normally valid reasons for storing data in one of these other formats. For example, BSQ are raster data with a separate text header file (.hdr) providing geographic spatial reference information. Earth observation data often monitors the electromagnetic spectrum in bands. Humans see in the visible range of the spectrum and our vision is composed of red, green and blue wavelengths. If we wanted to analyse just the red wavelength the BSQ format would let us read in only that data. In comparison a GeoTIFF might come with all the data packaged in one file and when doing analysis over thousands of images would significantly slow things down. That said you can now often find GeoTIFFs separated in a similar format to BSQ and its fairly straightforward to convert between raster formats. 1.4.2.6 Geodatabase A geodatabase is a collection of geographic data held within a database. Geodatabases were developed by ESRI to overcome some of the limitations of shapefiles. They come in two main types: Personal (up to 1 TB) and File (limited to 250 - 500 MB), with Personal Geodatabases storing everything in a Microsoft Access database (.mdb) file and File Geodatabases offering more flexibility, storing everything as a series of folders in a file system. In the example below we can see that the FCC_Geodatabase (left hand pane) holds multiple points, lines, polygons, tables and raster layers in the contents tab. 1.4.2.7 GeoPackage A GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial data. It stores spatial data layers (vector and raster) as a single file, and is based upon an SQLite database, a widely used relational database management system, permitting code based, reproducible and transparent workflows. As it stores data in a single file it is very easy to share, copy or move. 1.4.2.8 SpatiaLite SpatialLite is an open-source library that extends SQLite core. Support is fairly limited and most software that supports SpatiaLite also supports GeoPackage, as they both build upon SQLite. It doesnt have any clear advantage over GeoPackage, however it is unable to support raster data. 1.4.2.9 PostGIS PostGIS is an opensource database extender for PostrgeSQL. Essentially PostgreSQL is a database and PostGIS is an add on which permits spatial functions. The advantages of using PostGIS over a GeoPackage are that it allows users to access the data at the same time, can handle large data more efficiently and reduces processing time. In this example calculating the number of bars per neighbourhood in Leon, Mexico the processing time reduced from 1.443 seconds (SQLite) to 0.08 seconds in PostGIS. However, data stored in PostGIS is much harder to share, move or copy. 1.4.2.10 What will I use The variety of data formats can see a bit overwhelming. I still have to check how to load some of these data formats that I dont use frequently. But dont worry, most of the time youll be using shapefiles, GeoPackages or raster data. 1.5 General data flow As Grolemund and Wickham state in R for Data Science Data science is a huge field, and theres no way you can master it by reading a single book. However, a nice place to start is looking at the typical workflow of a data science (or GIS) project which you will see throuhgout these practicals, which is summarised nicely in this diagram produced by Dr. Julia Lowndes adpted from Grolemund and Wickham. To begin you have to import your data (not necessarily environmental) into R or someother kind of GIS to acatually be able to do any kind of analysis on it. Once imported you might need to tidy the data. This really depends on what kind of data it is and we cover this later on in the course. However, putting all of your data into a consistent structure will be very beneficial when you have to do analysis on it  as you can treat it all in the same way. Grolemund and Wickham state that data is tidy when each column is a variable, and each row is an observation, we cover this more in next week in the Tidying data section. When you have (or havent) tidied data you then will most likely want to transform it. Grolemund and Wickham define this as narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city, or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means). However, from a GIS point of view I would also include putting all of your data into a similar projection, covered next week in Changing projections and any other basic process you might do before the core analysis. Arguably these processes could include things such as: clipping (cookie cutting your study area), buffering (making areas within a distance of a point) and intersecting (where two datasets overlap). Tidying and transfrom = data wrangling. Remember from the introduction this could be 50-80% of a data science job! After you have transformed the data the next best thing to do is visualise it  even with some basic summary statistics. This simple step will often let you look at your data in a different way and select more appropraite analysis. Next up is modelling. Personally within GIS id say a better term is processing as the very data itself is usually a computer model of reality. The modelling or processing section is where you conduct the core analysis (more than the basic analysis already mentioned) and try to provide an answer to your research question. Fianlly you have to communicate your study and outputs, it doesnt matter how good your data wrangling, modelling or processing is, if your intended audience cant interpret it, well, its pretty much useless. In a few weeks come back and revisit this data flow section to see how what you have learnt fits the framework presented. 1.6 Data The volume of geographic information which is freely available for use in the UK is increasing exponentially and spatially referenced data can often be found in many different places. In this practical were going to use data from the London data store  a free and open data-sharing portal provided by the Greater London Authority (GLA), also known as City Hall that is the devolved regional governance body of London. We are going to get spatial data of the London boroughs and join flytipping (the illegal deposit of waste, commonly on road verges) data that is provided as a .csv file. .csv stands for comma-separated values (CSV)  it uses a comma to separate each value. At the end of this document Ill also run through some common sources of data that will stand you in good stead (be advantageous) for the rest of the course. 1.6.1 File paths In your N drive: create a new folder called GIS and within this a sub folder called wk1. It is up to you how you organise your files. Make sure you change the file paths where appropriate to your own. 1.6.2 Data download Firstly we need to get a spatial outline of the London boroughs. The geographic boundaries that are used in the UK are a complex, often inter-related, but ever changing mass of areas. For anyone new to the UK (or indeed not a trained quantitative geographer), it can be quite a daunting task to attempt to understand all of the boundaries that are in use. Fortunately the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has an online beginners guide to UK geography. If you need more information on the vast array of different UK geographies, go and explore these resources: A Beginners Guide to UK Geography (2019) v1.0 https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/9c04ff58854040d09a5a7ce146ab59b4 Lets download some data.. Spatial Data To get the data go to the London data store Search for Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London Download the statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip Unzip the data and save it to your wk1 folder. CSV data On the same website search for fly-tipping incidents Download the .csv file 1.6.3 Data pre-processing Question Open the .csv in Excel, what do you notice about how the data is stored? Answer The year is a column and for each area the values are repeated for different years. In our analysis it is easier to have the different years as a column and populated for each area. So, we want to go from this To this Scroll to the end of the .csv and look at the data in the final rows. The last year should be 2017-2018. If you have years such as 2018-2020 then delete these rows. As we are going to use this dataset in QGIS and R Ive done it in Excel using a pivot table. In future well use R to automate tasks like this. Go to Insert &gt; PivotTable Select the original table and create a PivotTable in a new worksheet The PivotTable Field box will appear, experiment with the different fields in each of the areas Ive used the following: Note how Ive altered the total_action_taken to the sum of as the original was displaying incorrectly, to do so: Click on drop down button for total_action_taken &gt; Value Field Settings &gt; select Sum Its important to think about what data we actually need in the next step and its good practice to avoid data redundancy where possible. Spoiler The spatial data we have downloaded already contains borough name, so we dont need it twice. However, we do need a field to link the two datasets on. You could use borough name, but when using text fields sometimes input variations can affect joins. For example, if you had the University of Manchester in one dataset and Manchester University in another the join would fail. Consequently its usually best to join datasets on a code field. Now save the Excel sheet that contains the pivot table as a new .csv. Make sure that the first row of data holds the column titles. Remove all empty rows. When saving the file also avoid any special characters (e.g. -) and spaces, use an underscore instead of spaces. Warning Spatial software does not like file names with spaces or special characters. Now its time to load, inspect and do some basic manipulation of this data. As mentioned in the lecture there are several GIS software types, here we will repeat the same process across QGIS and R. 1.6.4 QGIS 1.6.4.1 Load data Search for and open QGIS Click on the open data source manager. Just above the word browser in the top left of the screen Navigate to the London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp and add it, you then have to close the data source manager. You can right click on the layer to view the attribute table, however the .csv file must be loaded nto QGIS in order to join it to a shapefile. Open the data source manager and select Delimited Text Navigate to our .csv file and provide a suitable layer name Under Record and Fields Options make sure the number of header lines to discard is 0 and the First record has field names box is selected (this is assuming you left a title for each column in your .csv) Under Geometry Definition select No geometry (attribute table only) Does the sample data seem right? If so, click add then close Note Your .csv might have a extra header present (a row before Row Labels). You can either: (a) close this and go and delete this in the .csv now and reload it or (b) change the number of header lines to discard to 1 in the Record and Fields Options in the screenshot above. 1.6.4.2 Join data Right click on the London boroughs layer &gt; Properties &gt; Joins Click the plus button at the bottom of the box Complete the dialogue box 1.6.4.3 Export data Now lets export to a GeoPackage. Right click on the London boroughs layer &gt; Export &gt; Save Feature As Select the GeoPackage format and complete the File name (the saved file name for the GeoPackage) and the Layer name (the name for this layer within the GeoPackage). Recall that a GeoPackage can store many data layers as a single file The new layer will be added to the map, so you can remove the old one (Right click on the layer &gt; Remove Layer). Make sure you remove the right one! Weve now made a GeoPackage that we can connect our map project to. Under Browser, Right click on GeoPackage &gt; New Connection &gt; Navigate to your GeoPackage Click the down arrow left to GeoPackage and you should see the one you just navigated to. Click the down arrow on the database and you can see your layer. Now we are going to import our .csv into our GeoPackage. To do so go: Database &gt; DB Manager Select your GeoPackage in the left hand pane Import layer/file then select the .csv. Click Ok. Again, remember that the .csv in the Layers tab (bottom left) is the original. Remove it, then from the GeoPackage just click, hold and drag the .csv into the layer pane. Now lets make a quick thematic map Right click on your London boroughs layer &gt; Properties &gt; Symbology Select categorised and choose a data column and color ramp &gt; click Classify You could also select graduated, however our joined data fields are in the wrong data type. If you wish to change them follow this guide Save your QGIS project You should have produced something like this: We havent talked about the Coordiante Reference System (CRS) (or Spatial Reference System (SRS)) of our map document A coordinate reference system is a series of parameters that define the coordinate system. Within GIS we use geographic or projected coordinate systems. The former uses a three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations of Earth, whereas the latter is defined on a flat, two-dimensional surface giving it constant lengths, angles and areas. We cover this in much more detail later on in subsequent weeks. QGIS defaults to the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) WGS 84, or known by its European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) code 4326. However, when you add your first layer it will default the CRS of the layer. Well go into the background of EPSG next time. You can change the CRS by going Project &gt; Properties and selecting CRS in the left hand pane. You can also access the project CRS by just clicking on the EPSG code in the bottom right of your QGIS window, in the screenshot above click EPSG:27700. Note As we are going to open the same files in difference GIS systems it is important to close the software before moving on. If you dont then files can be locked and unreadable as they are still considered to be in use. 1.6.5 R 1.6.5.1 Introduction R is both a programming language and software environment, originally designed for statistical computing and graphics. Rs great strength is that it is open-source, can be used on any computer operating system and free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it is rapidly becoming the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a huge user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical and importantly for us, geographical tasks. The purpose of this practical is just to demonstrate data loading and manipulation in different software. The next practical will provide much more detail on R, so dont worry about that. In RStudio go: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script You should be able to see these quadrants (without the code): Below are bits of code, to start we will work using the console. So just copy the bits of code into the console window, changing the file names to where your data is stored. Then at the end of this section Ill show you how to make a script. R works on packages that are collections of functions and data. Packages are bits of code that extend R beyond the basic statistical functionality it was originally designed for. For spatial data, they enable R to process spatial data formats, carry out analysis tasks and create some of the maps that follow. Most pacakges are easily recognisable through a hexagon (hex) logo, or sticker. Mitchell OHara-Wild has even produced some code to make your own! Bascially, without packages, R would be very limited. With packages, you can do virtually anything! One of the issues you will come across is that packages are being continually developed and updated and unless you keep your version of R updated and your packages updated, there may be some functions and options not available to you. This can be a problem, particularly with University installations which (at best) may only get updated once a year. Therefore, apologies in advance if things dont work as intended, but there is often a work around. For this practical we will need the ones listed in the code chunk below. Whilst weve installed them (with the code below), we havent yet loaded them. Its best practice to do all this at the start of your code, however, for demonstration purposes Ill load each one as we need it. install.packages(c(&quot;sf&quot;, &quot;tmap&quot;, &quot;tmaptools&quot;, &quot;RSQLite&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;), repos = &quot;https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/&quot;) We can also install and load packages through RStudio. If you can see the package listed in the package tab it is installed and a tick means it is loaded. Packages weve installed with our code: sf: simple features, standard way to encode spatial vector data tmap: layer-based and easy approach to make thematic maps tmaptools: set of tools for reading and processing spatial data RSQLite: embeds the SQLite database engine in R Here, repos stands for repository where we will download the packages from. Once you have set it, you shouldnt need to specify it again. Whilst weve installed the packages we havent loaded themthis is done through using library() function. Thanks to Dianne Cook for this image If you are using a Mac you might also need rgdal this is because a lot of packages are dependent on it and it might not properly install install.packages(&quot;rgdal&quot;) Then load rgdal library(rgdal) If you still have issues the check out the Mac R issues section 1.6.5.2 Load data Load the sf package so we can read our shapefile in  remember to change to filepath to your shapefile. For this first practical well just leave the data where it is, next week well show you how to use projects to make calling data much easier. Note by default in R, the file path should be defined with / but on a windows file system it is defined with \\. Using \\\\ instead allows R to read the path correctly  alternatively, just use / library(sf) # change this to your file path!!! shape &lt;- st_read(&quot;Prac1_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&quot;) ## Reading layer `London_Borough_Excluding_MHW&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\Prac1_data\\statistical-gis-boundaries-london\\ESRI\\London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 33 features and 7 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 503568.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561957.5 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid Note If you are working on the UCL RStudio Server and have a shapefile (along with all the other relevant files required) you will just need to use shape &lt;- st_read(&quot;London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&quot;) As RStudio cloud knows you have setup a project and to look for files within itwe cover this very soon for RStudio desktop. To get a summary of the data held within the shapefile data (attribute table) enter the following: summary(shape) ## NAME GSS_CODE HECTARES NONLD_AREA ## Barking and Dagenham: 1 E09000001: 1 Min. : 314.9 Min. : 0.00 ## Barnet : 1 E09000002: 1 1st Qu.: 2724.9 1st Qu.: 0.00 ## Bexley : 1 E09000003: 1 Median : 3857.8 Median : 2.30 ## Brent : 1 E09000004: 1 Mean : 4832.4 Mean : 64.22 ## Bromley : 1 E09000005: 1 3rd Qu.: 5658.5 3rd Qu.: 95.60 ## Camden : 1 E09000006: 1 Max. :15013.5 Max. :370.62 ## (Other) :27 (Other) :27 ## ONS_INNER SUB_2009 SUB_2006 geometry ## F:19 NA&#39;s:33 NA&#39;s:33 MULTIPOLYGON :33 ## T:14 epsg:NA : 0 ## +proj=tmer...: 0 ## ## ## ## To have a quick look what the shapefile looks like enter the following: plot(shape) That plots everything in the shapefile (all the attitbues) if you just wanted the geometry (outline of the shape) you could use library(sf) ## Linking to GEOS 3.8.0, GDAL 3.0.4, PROJ 6.3.1 shape %&gt;% st_geometry() %&gt;% plot() From what we did in QGIS this should look familiar. We now need to load our .csv file: library(tidyverse) mycsv &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Prac1_data/fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## `Row Labels` = col_character(), ## `2011_12` = col_double(), ## `2012_13` = col_double(), ## `2013_14` = col_double(), ## `2014_15` = col_double(), ## `2015_16` = col_double(), ## `2016_17` = col_double(), ## `2017_18` = col_double(), ## Grand_Total = col_double() ## ) When you load tidyverse you might get a list of conflicts, this basically means that several packages have functions named the same thing. For example there is a function named filter() in the packages dplyr and stats. If you wanted to use the dplyr version you would use dplyr::filter() or for the stats version it would be stats::filter() Note Your .csv might have a extra header present (a row before Row Labels). You can either: (a) stop and go and delete this in the .csv now and reload it or (b) change the code to mycsv &lt;- read_csv(\"Prac1_data/fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv\", skip = 1) To view the data just input: mycsv ## # A tibble: 34 x 9 ## `Row Labels` `2011_12` `2012_13` `2013_14` `2014_15` `2015_16` `2016_17` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 E09000001 563 1492 433 347 587 1944 ## 2 E09000002 2687 2122 1399 3100 2672 1130 ## 3 E09000003 2356 1828 890 219 615 130 ## 4 E09000004 505 627 732 399 262 439 ## 5 E09000005 6713 2232 3189 3926 3980 4366 ## 6 E09000006 306 479 653 462 326 228 ## 7 E09000007 5541 5962 8281 4837 4719 4656 ## 8 E09000008 31 108 460 712 1707 637 ## 9 E09000009 6727 5679 6543 5521 6067 12688 ## 10 E09000010 7262 3595 3269 4937 5292 10894 ## # ... with 24 more rows, and 2 more variables: `2017_18` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Grand_Total &lt;dbl&gt; 1.6.5.3 Join data In R weve given our London boroughs shapefile the name shape and our flytipping .csv the name mycsv. If you look in the Environment quadrant you should see them both listed. Join the .csv to the shapefile. Here, replace Row Labels with whatever your GSS_CODE is called in the .csv: shape &lt;- shape%&gt;% merge(., mycsv, by.x=&quot;GSS_CODE&quot;, by.y=&quot;Row Labels&quot;) Lets break this down a bit. We just created a tibble of mycsv (this is a new form of a dataframe) where each column has a variable and each row contains a set of values  so basically a normal table. We did this simply by using read_csv() to read the data in. We then matched our csv to our shape based on the GSS_CODE values in both. Check the merge was successful, this is just going to show the top 10 rows: shape%&gt;% head(., n=10) ## Simple feature collection with 10 features and 15 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 509702.4 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 554089.2 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid ## GSS_CODE NAME HECTARES NONLD_AREA ONS_INNER SUB_2009 ## 1 E09000001 City of London 314.942 24.546 T &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 E09000002 Barking and Dagenham 3779.934 169.150 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 E09000003 Barnet 8674.837 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 E09000004 Bexley 6428.649 370.619 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 E09000005 Brent 4323.270 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 E09000006 Bromley 15013.487 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 E09000007 Camden 2178.932 0.000 T &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 E09000008 Croydon 8649.441 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 E09000009 Ealing 5554.428 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 E09000010 Enfield 8220.025 0.000 F &lt;NA&gt; ## SUB_2006 2011_12 2012_13 2013_14 2014_15 2015_16 2016_17 2017_18 Grand_Total ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; 563 1492 433 347 587 1944 2579 7945 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; 2687 2122 1399 3100 2672 1130 1066 14176 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 2356 1828 890 219 615 130 503 6541 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 505 627 732 399 262 439 327 3291 ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; 6713 2232 3189 3926 3980 4366 7483 31889 ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; 306 479 653 462 326 228 258 2712 ## 7 &lt;NA&gt; 5541 5962 8281 4837 4719 4656 12671 46667 ## 8 &lt;NA&gt; 31 108 460 712 1707 637 2684 6339 ## 9 &lt;NA&gt; 6727 5679 6543 5521 6067 12688 5471 48696 ## 10 &lt;NA&gt; 7262 3595 3269 4937 5292 10894 5855 41104 ## geometry ## 1 MULTIPOLYGON (((531145.1 18... ## 2 MULTIPOLYGON (((543905.4 18... ## 3 MULTIPOLYGON (((524579.9 19... ## 4 MULTIPOLYGON (((547226.2 18... ## 5 MULTIPOLYGON (((525201 1825... ## 6 MULTIPOLYGON (((540373.6 15... ## 7 MULTIPOLYGON (((528840.2 18... ## 8 MULTIPOLYGON (((535009.2 15... ## 9 MULTIPOLYGON (((510253.5 18... ## 10 MULTIPOLYGON (((531023.5 20... Now, lets make a quick thematic map (or a qtm) using the package tmap. Ive made mine for flytipping between 2011 and 2012 (column 2011_12). But check what your coloumn name is from the adove code head(shape, n=10) it might be slightly different like 2011-2012 or x2011_2012. library(tmap) tmap_mode(&quot;plot&quot;) ## tmap mode set to plotting # change the fill to your column name if different shape %&gt;% qtm(.,fill = &quot;2011_12&quot;) 1.6.6 Export data Finally write shape to a new GeoPackage (.gpkg) giving it the layer name of your choice: shape %&gt;% st_write(.,&quot;Prac1_data/Rwk1.gpkg&quot;, &quot;london_boroughs_fly_tipping&quot;, delete_layer=TRUE) ## Deleting layer `london_boroughs_fly_tipping&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; ## Writing layer `london_boroughs_fly_tipping&#39; to data source `Prac1_data/Rwk1.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; ## Writing 33 features with 15 fields and geometry type Multi Polygon. So here, we are saying the shape is the object we want to save, then to the GeoPackage file path, with the layer name of london_boroughs_fly_tipping. Ive set delete_layer to true so I could overwrite mine when I developed this practical. Changing it to false would generate an error message if you ever tried to re-run the code. Lets also add the .csv as we did in QGIS. This is a bit more complicated as we have to use the SQLite database package. Firstly, connect to the .gpkg we just made: library(readr) library(RSQLite) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),dbname=&quot;Prac1_data/Rwk1.gpkg&quot;) Now examine what is in the .gpkgyou can see that ive already got my original_csv stored within the .gpkg as when i developed this practical i made sure it was working! con %&gt;% dbListTables() ## [1] &quot;gpkg_contents&quot; ## [2] &quot;gpkg_extensions&quot; ## [3] &quot;gpkg_geometry_columns&quot; ## [4] &quot;gpkg_metadata&quot; ## [5] &quot;gpkg_metadata_reference&quot; ## [6] &quot;gpkg_ogr_contents&quot; ## [7] &quot;gpkg_spatial_ref_sys&quot; ## [8] &quot;gpkg_tile_matrix&quot; ## [9] &quot;gpkg_tile_matrix_set&quot; ## [10] &quot;london_boroughs_fly_tipping&quot; ## [11] &quot;original_csv&quot; ## [12] &quot;rtree_london_boroughs_fly_tipping_geom&quot; ## [13] &quot;rtree_london_boroughs_fly_tipping_geom_node&quot; ## [14] &quot;rtree_london_boroughs_fly_tipping_geom_parent&quot; ## [15] &quot;rtree_london_boroughs_fly_tipping_geom_rowid&quot; ## [16] &quot;sqlite_sequence&quot; Add your .csv and disconnect from the .gpkg: con %&gt;% dbWriteTable(., &quot;original_csv&quot;, mycsv, overwrite=TRUE) con %&gt;% dbDisconnect() Here overwrite lets you well..overwrite the exisiting fileif this wasnt specified as true you would get an error saying the file already existed if you tried to run this code again. 1.6.6.1 Making a script To convert this bit of analysis into a script that we could save and run again in future, I would write the following in the script quadrant: library(sf) library(tmap) library(tmaptools) library(RSQLite) library(tidyverse) #read in the shapefile shape &lt;- st_read( &quot;Prac1_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&quot;) # read in the csv mycsv &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Prac1_data/fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv&quot;) # merge csv and shapefile shape &lt;- shape%&gt;% merge(., mycsv, by.x=&quot;GSS_CODE&quot;, by.y=&quot;Row Labels&quot;) # set tmap to plot tmap_mode(&quot;plot&quot;) # have a look at the map qtm(shape, fill = &quot;2011_12&quot;) # write to a .gpkg shape %&gt;% st_write(.,&quot;Prac1_data/Rwk1.gpkg&quot;, &quot;london_boroughs_fly_tipping&quot;, delete_layer=TRUE) # connect to the .gpkg con &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(),dbname=&quot;Prac1_data/Rwk1.gpkg&quot;) # list what is in it con %&gt;% dbListTables() # add the original .csv con %&gt;% dbWriteTable(., &quot;original_csv&quot;, mycsv, overwrite=TRUE) # disconnect from it con %&gt;% dbDisconnect() You can then save your script through File &gt; Save As. If you are on a Mac you might also need to load rgdaljust add the following at the top of the script. library(rgdal) 1.6.7 What will I use Well it depends. If you wanted to quickly open a dataset to explore its contents then Id use QGIS. However, if you had 100 raster images that you wanted to clip to your study area, Id automate it in R. There are also specific packages developed for each type of software that might dictate what you use, for example I recently made use of the Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP) plugin in QGIS. That said, as I needed to match different hourly meteorological variables over a three year period I automated the first part of the analysis in R and loaded a .csv into QGIS. Recent advancments have also closed the gap somewhat between Graphic User Interface (GUI) GIS software (such as QGIS) and programming languages (such as R) with bridges that allow you to control GUI software through code. To learn more about these bridges read Lovelace et al. (2019) chapter 9. 1.7 Data sources and task Below Ive listed a few good data sources. Explore these and any others you can find and get an interesting dataset (e.g. in this practical our flytipping .csv) that you could join to some spatial data (e.g. in this practical the London boroughs .shp). This could be for any location in the world. 1.7.1 UK Data Service The UK Data Service geography service (https://census.edina.ac.uk/) has a library of hundreds of current and former boundary datasets for which attribute data are produced in the UK. 1.7.2 ONS The Office for National Statistics (ONS) are the national statistical agency for England and Wales and have recently started to provide access to boundary data for the statistics they produce for various geographic areas. Many of the boundaries on the ONS Geoportal are also available from the Edina Census Geography website in a more flexible fashion, however the ONS website provides very quick access to bulk-downloads  something which can be very useful when reading data directly from the web using computer software. From the ONS website you can also extract the URL at which the data is stored to use directly within your future code 1.7.3 nomis Nomis is provided by the ONS giving free access to UK labour market statistics. You can also bulk download census data from the site too! 1.7.4 OS The Ordnance Survey (OS) are the national mapping agency for the UK. A few years ago, they opened up a number of their data products for public use including greenspace, OS Open Map and OS Terrain. For the full range see: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/finder.html?Licensed%20for=OpenData%20(Free)&amp;withdrawn=on 1.7.5 Edina Digimap Before the Ordnance Survey opened up much of its data for public use, academics and students in the UK could access OS data using the Edina Digimap Service  this service is still available today and provides access to a number of products in addition to those available from OS Open Data. Perhaps the most exciting of the additional OS data products available from Digimap is OS MasterMap. MasterMap is a framework for all OS data and contains layers of data that include details of real world objects such as buildings, roads, paths, rivers, physical structures and land parcels, as well as the complete UK transport network. Whilst we still are required to go through Edina OS have recently announced plans to make this dataset free in the near future under the new Geospatial Commission. 1.7.6 OSM Open Street Map (OSM) is a fantastic resource  as the name suggests, all data contained in Open Street Map are open and free for anyone to use. Much like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute content to OSM and this brings with it its own benefits (frequent updates, very large user-base) and problems (data quality and patch coverage). OSM is a very good example of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Its possible to download OSM data straight from the website, although the interface can be a little unreliable (it works better for small areas). There are, however, a number of websites that allow OSM data to be downloaded more easily and are directly linked to from the Export option in OSM. Geofabrik (https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html) allows you to download frequently updated Shapefiles for various global subdivisions. 1.7.7 DEFRA The Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) have recently created the Data Services Platform to openly distribute environmental data. See: https://environment.data.gov.uk/ 1.7.8 Data lists Another good place to start searching for data are data lists. They simply provide a comprehensive overview of all available data conveniently categorised by discipline and country. I normally use this one: https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/ 1.8 Summary Within this practical we have explored the different types, formats and software used to store, analyse and manipulate spatial data. In reflecting upon this practical you should consider the (dis)advantages of each, where and when they might be appropriate and the overall practicality. Next week we will delve further into R and RStudio. 1.9 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form. Its anonymous and well use the responses to clear any issues up in the future / adapt the material. 1.10 Mac R issues If you have a Mac and run into issues using R, try this It seems that a lot of the packages are dependent on rgdal, which might not properly install Order of operations Install java JDK (to respond to error Unable to find any JVMs matching version (null), which occurred when we tried to load OpenStreetMap package in RStudio) Download and install the appropriate .dmg from Java SE Development Kit 11.0.1 Run sudo R CMD javareconf in Terminal as described in this tutorial(though dont follow this tutorial exactly, just up to that terminal command). (Maybe) restart your computer (not really sure when this is necessary). Install GDAL GDAL, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, appears to be a massively important package / library / whatever that a lot of the spatial tools we use depends on. This is where things might be sticky  we already installed GDAL for QGIS, but obviously RStudio cant find that install  dunno how to update the pointers, but we found that installing GDAL (again?) solved it. We HOPE that this didnt ruin or break any other software weve installed, only time will tell :grimacing: To install GDAL on a mac, first (if you havent) install homebrew, the mac package manager This can be done by executing /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" in Terminal, inputting password etc. Now were ready to brew install gdal (also in Terminal), which will run through and install a massive list of dependencies etc. Set up RStudio Restart RStudio (if the following doesnt work on first go) Run through all the install.packages() commands one by one in RStudio and check to make sure that they install. Check if rgdal package is working. Check the other packages OpenStreetMap, tmap, etc. "],["introduction-to-r.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to R 2.1 Learning outcomes 2.2 Homework 2.3 Recommended listening  2.4 Introduction 2.5 Reading data into R 2.6 Tidying data 2.7 Feedback", " Chapter 2 Introduction to R 2.1 Learning outcomes By the end of this practical you should be able to: Execute basic processing in R Examine, clean and manipulate comma seperate value (.csv) data Examine, clean and manipulate and plot spatial (.shp) data Produce interactive maps Evaluate the benefits of different data manipulation and mapping techniques 2.2 Homework Outside of our schedulded sessions you should be doing around 12 hours of extra study per week. Feel free to follow your own GIS interests, but good places to start include the following: Assignment This week you need to assess the validity of your topic in terms of data suitability, then sketch out an introduction and literature review including academic and policy documents (or any reputable source). Reading This week: Chapter 2 Geographic data in R from Geocomputation with R by Lovelace, Nowosad and Muenchow (2020). How to Write a Paper for Publication by Rosenfeldt et al. (2000). Watching The series of short (2min) videos produced by RStudio on programming basics Hadley Wickhams Keynote from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). This will be the same for a few weeks. Remember this is just a starting point, explore the reading list, practical and lecture for more ideas. 2.3 Recommended listening  Some of these practicals are long, take regular breaks and have a listen to some of our fav tunes each week. Andy. Dermot Kennedy, might give you the chills with his pure voice. I saw him live last year at All Points East in London. Orginally was well known from the Spotify Discover Weekly where he used to self publish songs. Adam. Change of genre this week, but this will still melt your brains! I first saw this band in Cambridge in about 2004 when we were both still young! 16 years later, theyre now a massive platinum-selling Rock juggernaut with their latest singles bothering the playlists of the worlds most popular radio stations and their live-shows conquering the biggest festivals. Mon the Biff. It is of course Biffy Clyro! Heres their latest album - A Celebration of Endings - 2.4 Introduction This practical is LONG but it will take you from not knowing much about R to making freaking cool interactive maps in one practical. As you can imagine, this will be a steep learning curve. I will give you all the code you need, its your job to read through the text very carefully and try to understand what bits of code are doing as you go. There will be bits of code you dont fully understand. Dont worry, the key is to revisit later and try to work out what is going on then. Learning R is a long and iterative process and this is just the start If you want to learn more about R and indeed download the latest version for your own use, then visit the R project pages The Wikipedia page for those who want to know a little of the history of R can be found here There is an almost endless supply of good R tutorials on the web. If you get stuck or want to learn even more R (and why would you not want to?!), Id recommend trying some of the following R Tutorial websites: http://www.statmethods.net/index.html http://www.r-tutor.com/ http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/index.html http://www.cookbook-r.com/ If you want to really be up to date with the state of the art in R, then bookdown is a fantastic resource. It features free books by some of the pre-eminent names in the R scene  I would urge you to go and take a look. 2.4.1 Online forums are your friend!! With almost every problem you encounter with R, someone else will have had the same problem before you and posted it on a forum  someone will then post a solution below. My usual route is to Google the problem and Ill then be directed to a post, usually on Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange or Cross Validated. When doing so try to think about the minimal working (or not working) example (MWE), by this i mean remove anything very specific to your problem. Ive rarely not found a solution to a problem this way. 2.4.2 Health warning Beware of posting questions on these forums yourself  contributors to these forums (especially the R ones!), whilst almost always extremely knowledgeable about R, have a bit of a reputation for being insert familiar pejorative term for less-than-polite-human-being here! As you might expect, people who have enough time to become total experts in R, have little time to work on their social skills!! Fortunately though, some other poor chump has usually taken that hit for you and you can still find a useful answer to your problem. If you are specifically more interested in the spatial side of R, then Alex Singleton and Chris Brunsdon at the Universities of Liverpool and Maynooth also have a number of very useful R Spatial Tutorials  http://rpubs.com/alexsingleton/ &amp; http://rpubs.com/chrisbrunsdon/ Robin Lovelace in Leeds is also frequently at the bleeding edge of developments in R spatial stuff, so keep an eye on his website. Robin has also made a book on GeoComputation in R, which you should definitely read!  https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ These websites are also very very good: https://pakillo.github.io/R-GIS-tutorial/ and http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Teaching/UseR2012/cheatsheet.html 2.4.3 R and RStudio When you download and install R, you get the R Graphical User Interface (GUI) as standard (below). This is fine and some purists prefer using the clean, unfussy command-line original, but it has some limitations such as no graphical way to view data tables or keep track of what is in your working directory (there are a number of others too). Fortunately there are a number of software environments that have been developed for R to make it a little more user-friendly; the best of these by a long way is RStudio. RStudio can be downloaded for free from https://www.rstudio.com/. We covered the RStudio layout last week. 2.4.4 Getting started If you are some kind of masochist, you are welcome to use the bundled R GUI for all of your work. If pain is not your thing, then for this practical (and future practicals) I will assume that you are using RStudio. From the start menu on your computer, find and run RStudio Once RStudio has opened, the first thing we will do is create a new project  projects enable you to organise your work effectively and store all of the files you create and work with for a particular task. To create a new project (and this will vary a little depending on the version of RStudio you are using) select File &gt; New Project Select Start a project in a brand new working directory and create a new project in a directory of a new wk2 directory on your N: drive: My file directory (the second box here) will be different to yours as this is my teaching resources folder. Keep yours simple N:/GIS/wk2. Setting up a project is extremely useful as it lets you easily access your data and filesfor example.the flytipping .csv we used last week is stored at the file path mycsv &lt;- read_csv(&quot;C:/Teaching/CASA0005repo/Prac1_data/fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv&quot;) However as ive set my R project up in the CASA0005repo folder with different data folders for each week i can just use: mycsv &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Prac1_data/fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv&quot;) If i had the .csv file in the same folder as my project i could just use mycsv &lt;- read_csv(&quot;fly_tipping_borough_edit.csv&quot;) You can run this in the Console area now or within a script which we will now go over Id strongly recommend you think about how you will store data within your project. Is it sensible to just dump all your data into the project folder or perahps create a new folder (either in R) or how you would normally do so in Windows / OS X and keep your raw data in that folderlike i have doneHere you can see that im in my project folder (red box on the right) and ive made new folders for all my data (each practical here) and images that are shown throuhgout.nice and organised! 2.4.5 Basics R has a very steep learning curve, but hopefully it wont take long to get your head around the basics. For example, at its most simple R can be used as a calculator. In the console window (bottom left), just type the following and press enter: 1+5 ## [1] 6 or 4*5^2 ## [1] 100 As you can see R performs these calculations instantly and prints the results in the console. This is useful for quick calculations but less useful for writing scripts requiring multiple operations or saving these for future use. To save your scripts, you should create a new R Script file. Do this now: Select File &gt; New File &gt; R Script. The R Script should open up on the top-left of your GUI. From now on type everything in this R script file and save it 2.4.6 Scripts and some basic commands Usually one of the first things to do when starting a new R Script is to check that you are in the correct working directory. This is important especially if you are working on multiple projects in different locations. To do this type the following into your new empty R Script: getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo&quot; To run this line, hold Ctrl (Cmd on a Mac) and press the Return() key (if you are in the standard R installation, you would run your script with Ctrl R). You should now see your current working directory appear in the console. Because of the new project we have already set up, this working directory should be correct, but if for any reason we wanted to change the working directory, we would use the setwd() function. For example, we wanted to change our directory to the documents folder on the C drive, we could run (dont do this now): setwd(&quot;C:/Documents&quot;) When we are sure we are working in the correct working directory, we can save our script by clicking on the save icon on the script tab. Save your script as something like wk2_part1 and you will see it appear in your files window on the right hand side. As you build up a document of R code, you should get into the habit of saving your script periodically in case of an unexpected software crash. We can now begin to write a script without the need to run each line every time we press enter. In the script editor type: A &lt;- 1 B &lt;- 2 C &lt;- A+B C ## [1] 3 Select (highlight) the three lines and run all three lines with Ctrl Return(). You will notice the lines appear in the console (the other window). If you type C and press enter in the console (C and then ctrl return in the script window) you should have the number 3 appear. From now on I recommend you type all the commands below in the script first and then run them. Copying and pasting from this document wont necessarily work. You will also notice that in RStudio, values A, B and C will appear in your workspace window (top right). These variables are stored in memory for future use. Try giving A and B different values and see what happens. What about if you use lower case letters? You have just demonstrated one of the powerful aspects of R, which is that it is an object oriented programming language. A, B and C are all objects that have been assigned a value with the &lt;- symbol (you can also use the = sign, but it operates slightly differently to &lt;- in R, plus the arrow assignment has become standard over the years. Use alt - to type it automatically). This principle underlies the whole language and enables users to create ever more complex objects as they progress through their analysis. If you type: ls() ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;all_pkgs&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;con&quot; &quot;mycsv&quot; &quot;session&quot; ## [8] &quot;shape&quot; R will produce a list of objects that are currently active. rm(A) will remove the object A from the workspace (do ls() again to check this or look in your workspace window). 2.4.7 Functions Both rm() and ls() are known as functions. Functions are the other fundamental aspect to the R language. Functions can be thought of as single or multiple calculations that you apply to objects. They generally take the form of(dont run these) function(object, argument1, argument2, argument3) Where the object is some form of data and the arguments parameterise what the function will do. You could save the ouput to a new object using something like X&lt;-function(data, argument1, argument2, argument3) You can write your own functions to carry out tasks (and well come onto that in subsequent practical sessions), but normally you will just used one of the virtually infinite number of functions that other people have already written for us. 2.4.8 Basic plotting One common function is the plot() function for displaying data as a graphical output. Add these lines to your script and run them as before and you can see some plot() outputs: #create some datasets, first a vector of 1-100 and 101-200 Data1 &lt;- c(1:100) Data2 &lt;- c(101:200) #Plot the data plot(Data1, Data2, col=&quot;red&quot;) #just for fun, create some more, this time some normally distributed #vectors of 100 numbers Data3 &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 53, sd=34) Data4 &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 64, sd=14) #plot plot(Data3, Data4, col=&quot;blue&quot;) In the code above, you will have noticed the # symbol. This signifies that whatever comes after it on that line is a comment. Comments are ignored by the R console and they allow you to annotate your code so that you know what it is doing. It is good programming practice to comment your code extensively so that you can keep track of what your scripts are for. Warning Heed our advice now and comment your code it will save you time in the future! 2.4.9 Help The previous lines of code also demonstrated a number of functions: c() concatenates a string of numbers together into a vector. 1:100 means produce the integers between and including 1:100, the plot() function plots the two data objects and includes a parameter to change the colour of the points. To understand what a function does, you can consult the R Help system. Simply type a question mark and then the function name; for example: ?plot In RStudio you will see the help file appear in the Help window in the bottom right of the GUI. Here you can also search for the help files for other functions in the search bar. 2.4.10 Data structures Objects in R can exist as a number of different data structures. These include a matrix, an array, a vector, a data frame and a list. The main criteria for division of these structures is data type homogeneity. A vector, matrix and array must only contain data of the same type (e.g. numeric or text) A list or data frame can contain a mixture of data types (e.g. numeric and text). Further divisions are then made based on the number of dimesions (1D, 2D, 3D or more) each can have For the purposes of this practical we will focus on data frames. These are the most flexible data format in R (although tibbles are now becoming popular as well  they are just more flexible versions of data frames, for example they can have a list as a column). Data frames can be conceptualised in a similar way to a spreadsheet with data held in rows and columns. They are the most commonly used object type in R and the most straightforward to create from the two vector objects we just created. df &lt;- data.frame(Data1, Data2) plot(df, col=&quot;green&quot;) If you have a very large data frame (thousands or millions of rows) it is useful to see only a selection of these. There are several ways of doing this: library(tidyverse) #show the first 10 and then last 10 rows of data in df... df %&gt;% head() df %&gt;% tail() You might have noticed the syntax (code) %&gt;%, this is called a pipe and is an operator is part from the magrittr package. magrittr is an entirely new way of thinking about R syntax that cleraly expresses a sequence of multiple operations. It is useful to think of the pipe operator as simply meaning then. Do this THEN do this THEN do that. You can also view elements of your data frame in RStudio by simply clicking on it in the top-right Environment window: 2.4.11 Elements of a data frame When programming you will frequently want to refer to different elements in a data frame or a vector/list. To select elements of a data frame, or subset it, you can refer specifically to ranges or elements of rows and columns. These are accessed using the single square bracket operator [], with the form: data.frame[row,column] Rows are always referenced first, before the comma, columns second, after the comma. Try the subsetting your df data frame with the following commands to see what is returned: df[1:10, 1] df[5:15,] df[c(2,3,6),2] df[,1] You will note that the column headings are the names of the original objects creating the data frame. We can change these using the rename() function from dplyr that is loaded as part of the tidyverse package, we will come to this next: df &lt;- df %&gt;% dplyr::rename(column1 = Data1, column2=Data2) dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, it has multiple verbs that allow you to change your data into a suitable format. These include select(), filter(), summarise(), which can also be applied to groups in datasets using group_by(). dplyr will be used throughout this course. In the majority of cases you provide some kind of data to dplyr followed by a %&gt;% then a verb (or other function), then another %&gt;% and more verbs of functions if needed. As in the code above you can also assign the output to an object with &lt;-. To select or refer to columns directly by name, we can either use dplyr again! df %&gt;% select(column1) However, you should be aware of other methods for doing this, as not all spatial data is compatible with dplyr yet, such as raster data, which will be important for next week. So we can also use the $ operator, which takes the form data.frame$columnName, e.g. df$column1 or we can use the double square bracket operator [[]], and refer to our column by name using quotes e.g. df[[&quot;column1&quot;]] This again is useful if you have a lot of columns and you wish to efficiently extract one of them. 2.5 Reading data into R One of the most tedious things a spatial analyst / data scientist has to do is clean their data so it doesnt cause problems for the software later. In the past, we would have needed to do this by hand  these days, we can use software to do much of this for us. I will now give you two options to arrive at a nice cleaned dataset. For this example we are going to use the London Datastore Catalogue. Go to the London Data store and get the Ward Profiles and Atlas and download the excel document for ward profiles. 2.5.1 Old skool cleaning Open the ward-profiles-excel-version.xls file in Excel, and save as LondonData.csv into your RProject folder, week 2. Open your new .csv file in Excel. There might be some non-numeric values inside numeric columns which will cause problems in your analysis. These need to be removed before proceeding any further. To remove these, you can use the replace function in Excel. In the home tab under Editing open up the find and replace dialogue box and enter the following into the find box: #VALUE! n/a Leave the replace box empty each time and click Replace All to remove these from your file, before saving the file again. Once you have cleaned out all of the trixy characters from the file, to read it into R, we will use the read.csv() function: LondonDataOSK&lt;- read.csv(&quot;prac2_data/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, encoding = &quot;latin1&quot;) Note, Ive made an R project for all these practicals, which is why my file path starts with prac2_data/. If you save the .csv in the same folder as the .Rproj then you can just use: LondonDataOSK&lt;- read.csv(&quot;ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, sep=&quot;,&quot;) If you look at the read.csv() help file - ?read.csv - you will see that we can actually include many more parameters when reading in a .csv file. For example, we could read in the same file as follows: # by default in R, the file path should be defined with / #but on a windows file system it is defined with \\. #Using \\\\ instead allows R #to read the path correctly  alternatively, just use / LondonDataOSK&lt;- read.csv(&quot;prac2_data/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, encoding = &quot;latin1&quot;) This would specify that the first row of the file contains header information; and the values in the file are separated with commas (not ; or : as can be the case sometimes). 2.5.2 Here However, this is also another more straightforward way to read in files that was devloped in 2017 to make it more intuitive to find and load files using the here package. You need to install and load it: install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) library(here) ## here() starts at C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo Think of here() as a command that is just poitning to a file path, to find out where is pointing use here::here() This is my working directory for this book project! Now i can use this to load my data that is in my practical 2 folder just like this. LondonDataOSK&lt;- read.csv(here::here(&quot;prac2_data&quot;,&quot;ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;), header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, encoding = &quot;latin1&quot;) This just removes any need for ever using a / or \\\\ in your file path. As with everything in code, there is no right way, use what suits you. 2.5.3 New skool cleaning To clean our data as we read it in, we are going to use a package called readr which also comes bundled as part of the tidyverse package. The tidyverse is simply a collection of pacakges relevant for data science, containing almost everything you need to become a kick-ass data scientist. Now lets use the readr package that allows loads of data manipulation for example Here we will use it to just read in a .csv file (directly from the web this time  read.csv can do this too) and clean text characters out from the numeric columns before they cause problems: #wang the data in straight from the web using read_csv, #skipping over the &#39;n/a&#39; entries as you go... LondonData &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://files.datapress.com/london/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas/2015-09-24T14:21:24/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, locale = locale(encoding = &quot;latin1&quot;), na = &quot;n/a&quot;) Note the use of read_csv here as opposed to read.csv. They are very similar, but read_csv is just a bit better. Read this blog post for more information. Also, for those python fans out there ITS NOT THE SAME FUNCTION AS READ_CSV IN PYTHON What is locale = locale(encoding = \"latin1\")?good questionit is basically the encoding of the data (how it is stored). There are a few different formats such as UTF-8 and latin1. In latin1 each character is 1 byte long, in UTF-8 a character can consist of more than 1 byte. To my knowledge the default in R is encoded as latin1, but readr (the package we are using to read in the .csv is UTF-8 so we have to specify it. 2.5.4 Examining your new data Your new data has been read in as a data frame / tibble (remember a tibble is just a data frame with a few extra bells and whistles). If you ever need to check what data type your new data set is, we can use the class() function: class(LondonData) ## [1] &quot;spec_tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; # or, if you have your old skool data class(LondonDataOSK) We can also use the class() function (from base R) within another two functions summarise_all() (from dplyr) and pivot_longer() (from tidyr) to check that our data has been read in correctly and that, for example, numeric data havent been read in as text or other variables. Run the following line of code: Datatypelist &lt;- LondonData %&gt;% summarise_all(class) %&gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=&quot;All_variables&quot;, values_to=&quot;Variable_class&quot;) Datatypelist ## # A tibble: 67 x 2 ## All_variables Variable_class ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Ward name character ## 2 Old code character ## 3 New code character ## 4 Population - 2015 numeric ## 5 Children aged 0-15 - 2015 numeric ## 6 Working-age (16-64) - 2015 numeric ## 7 Older people aged 65+ - 2015 numeric ## 8 % All Children aged 0-15 - 2015 numeric ## 9 % All Working-age (16-64) - 2015 numeric ## 10 % All Older people aged 65+ - 2015 numeric ## # ... with 57 more rows We cover pivot_longer() later in this practical, but for now weve simply grouped all our variables into one LONG column adding another column that contains the class. You should see that all columns that should be numbers are read in as numeric. Try reading in LondonData again, but this time without excluding the n/a values in the file, e.g. LondonData &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://files.datapress.com/london/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas/2015-09-24T14:21:24/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, locale = locale(encoding = &quot;latin1&quot;)) Now run the Datatypelist code again  you should see that some of the columns (those the n/a values in) have been read in as something other than numeric. This is why we need to exclude them. Isnt readr great for helping us avoid reading in our numeric data as text! If you ever wish to quickly edit data, then use edit() LondonData &lt;- edit(LondonData) It is also possible to quickly and easily summarise the data or look at the column headers using summary(df) ## column1 column2 ## Min. : 1.00 Min. :101.0 ## 1st Qu.: 25.75 1st Qu.:125.8 ## Median : 50.50 Median :150.5 ## Mean : 50.50 Mean :150.5 ## 3rd Qu.: 75.25 3rd Qu.:175.2 ## Max. :100.00 Max. :200.0 LondonData%&gt;% colnames()%&gt;% # just look at the head, top5 head() ## [1] &quot;Ward name&quot; &quot;Old code&quot; ## [3] &quot;New code&quot; &quot;Population - 2015&quot; ## [5] &quot;Children aged 0-15 - 2015&quot; &quot;Working-age (16-64) - 2015&quot; 2.5.5 Data manipulation in R Now we have some data read into R, we need to select a small subset to work on. The first thing we will do is select just the London Boroughs to work with. If you recall, the Borough data is at the bottom of the file. 2.5.5.1 Selecting rows Your borough data will probably be found between rows 626 and 658. Therefore we will first create a subset by selecting these rows into a new data frame and then reducing that data frame to just four columns. There are a few ways of doing this: We could select just the rows we need by explicitly specifying the range of rows we need: LondonBoroughs&lt;-LondonData[626:658,] We can also do this with dplyr with the slice() function, taking a slice out of the dataset LondonBoroughs&lt;-LondonData%&gt;% slice(626:658) However, we can instead try a cool data sciency way of pulling out the rows we want with the knowledge that the codes for London Boroughs start with E09 (the wards in the rest of the file start with E05). dplyr has a cool function called filter()that lets you subset rows based on conditions Here, we could filter based on a variable, for example extracting all the wards where female life expextancy is greather than 90. Femalelifeexp&lt;- LondonData %&gt;% filter(`Female life expectancy -2009-13`&gt;90) However, our New code column that holds Borough codes cant be filtered like this as its in a character formatin cases like this we can use the function str_detect() from the stringr package in combination with filter() from dplyr. Both these packages are part of the tidyverse again! LondonBoroughs&lt;- LondonData %&gt;% filter(str_detect(`New code`, &quot;^E09&quot;)) Check it worked: LondonBoroughs$`Ward name` Thats also the same as: LondonBoroughs %&gt;% select(`Ward name`) %&gt;% print() AWWMAHGAWD!!! Pretty cool hey? What that code is saying is stringr look for (detect!) the rows that have the ward code like E09, then filter these and store in the object LondonBoroughs The stringr package is really great and if you ever need to manipulate text type data then its the place to start. You will notice that you will have two rows at the top for the City of London. This is because it features twice in the data set. Thats fine, extract only unique rows with distinct(), again from dplyr: LondonBoroughs&lt;-LondonBoroughs %&gt;% distinct() 2.5.5.2 Selecting columns We can select columns if we know which index we want, starting from the first column thats 1.. #select columns 1,19,20 and 21 LondonBoroughs_manualcols&lt;-LondonBoroughs[,c(1,19,20,21)] We can also replicate this with dplyr with select() #select columns 1,19,20 and 21 LondonBoroughs_dplyrcols&lt;-LondonBoroughs %&gt;% select(c(1,19,20,21)) You will have noticed the use of square brackets above  these are very useful in R. The c() function is also used here  this is the combine function  another very useful function in R which allows arguments (in this case, column reference numbers) into a single value. However, we could also again use a more data sciency wayselecting the columns that contain certain words  LondonBoroughs_contains&lt;-LondonBoroughs %&gt;% select(contains(&quot;expectancy&quot;), contains(&quot;obese - 2011/12 to 2013/14&quot;), contains(&quot;Ward name&quot;)) 2.5.5.3 Renaming columns You will notice that the column names are slightly misleading as we are now working with boroughs rather than wards. You probably will also be annoyed (like me!) that the column names are full of ... that just make eveything hard to read. So, lets rename the wards column to boroughs (using rename() like we did earlier), then using the Janitor package tidy everything up library(janitor) LondonBoroughs &lt;- LondonBoroughs %&gt;% dplyr::rename(Borough=`Ward name`)%&gt;% clean_names() By defualt Janitor removes all capitals and uses an underscore wherever there is a space, this would be the same as using setting the case argument to snake If you wanted to now change it every word having a capital letter you would runbut dont do this now. LondonBoroughs &lt;- LondonBoroughs %&gt;% #here the ., means all data clean_names(., case=&quot;big_camel&quot;) 2.5.5.4 More dplyr verbs What about determining both (a) the average of male and female life expectancy together and (b) a normalised value for each London borough based on the London average. Then selecting only the name of the Borough, mean life expectancy and normalised life expectancy, arranging the output based on the normalised life expectancy in descending order To do this we will rely on the mutate() function that lets us add new variables based on existing ones Life_expectancy &lt;- LondonBoroughs %&gt;% #new column with average of male and female life expectancy mutate(averagelifeexpectancy= (female_life_expectancy_2009_13 + male_life_expectancy_2009_13)/2)%&gt;% #new column with normalised life expectancy mutate(normalisedlifeepectancy= averagelifeexpectancy / mean(averagelifeexpectancy))%&gt;% #select only columns we want select(new_code, borough, averagelifeexpectancy, normalisedlifeepectancy)%&gt;% #arrange in descending order #ascending is the default and would be #arrange(normalisedlifeepectancy) arrange(desc(normalisedlifeepectancy)) We can also use dplyr to show us the top and bottom number of rows instead of using head or tail like we did earlier. #top of data slice_head(Life_expectancy, n=5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## new_code borough averagelifeexpectancy normalisedlifeepectancy ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 E09000001 City of London 86.4 1.05 ## 2 E09000020 Kensington and Chelsea 84.4 1.03 ## 3 E09000015 Harrow 84.2 1.02 ## 4 E09000027 Richmond upon Thames 83.9 1.02 ## 5 E09000033 Westminster 83.8 1.02 #bottom of data slice_tail(Life_expectancy,n=5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## new_code borough averagelifeexpectancy normalisedlifeepectancy ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 E09000011 Greenwich 80.8 0.983 ## 2 E09000012 Hackney 80.7 0.982 ## 3 E09000025 Newham 80.6 0.980 ## 4 E09000002 Barking and Dagenham 80.1 0.974 ## 5 E09000030 Tower Hamlets 80.0 0.974 2.5.5.5 Levelling up withdplyr So far, weve really just covered basic operations with dplyr that you might have previously done in Excel. However, dplyr has much more powerful functions that can make advanced data wrangling a breeze. Whilst weve looked at life expectancy in the London boroughs relative to each other, how does the life expectancy of the London Boroughs compare the the UK average of 81.16? To answer this question we can use the case_when(), whereby if the value is greater than 81.16 we can assign the Borough a string of above UK average, and if below a string of below UK average. Life_expectancy2 &lt;- Life_expectancy %&gt;% mutate(UKcompare = case_when(averagelifeexpectancy&gt;81.16 ~ &quot;above UK average&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;below UK average&quot;)) Life_expectancy2 ## # A tibble: 33 x 5 ## new_code borough averagelifeexpect~ normalisedlifeepec~ UKcompare ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 E09000001 City of London 86.4 1.05 above UK av~ ## 2 E09000020 Kensington and~ 84.4 1.03 above UK av~ ## 3 E09000015 Harrow 84.2 1.02 above UK av~ ## 4 E09000027 Richmond upon ~ 83.9 1.02 above UK av~ ## 5 E09000033 Westminster 83.8 1.02 above UK av~ ## 6 E09000007 Camden 83.6 1.02 above UK av~ ## 7 E09000003 Barnet 83.4 1.02 above UK av~ ## 8 E09000006 Bromley 83.1 1.01 above UK av~ ## 9 E09000021 Kingston upon ~ 82.9 1.01 above UK av~ ## 10 E09000005 Brent 82.4 1.00 above UK av~ ## # ... with 23 more rows Now whilst this is useful, it doesnt tell is much more about the data itself, what if we wanted to know the range of life expectancies for London Boroughs that are above the national average. Life_expectancy2_group &lt;- Life_expectancy2 %&gt;% mutate(UKdiff = averagelifeexpectancy-81.16) %&gt;% group_by(UKcompare )%&gt;% summarise(range=max(UKdiff)-min(UKdiff), count=n(), Average=mean(UKdiff)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) Life_expectancy2_group ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## UKcompare range count Average ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 above UK average 5.25 25 1.52 ## 2 below UK average 0.9 8 -0.572 This is useful, but now what if we wanted to have more information based on the distribution of the Boroughs compared to the national average, as opposed to just over or under.there are a few ways to do this.. We are going to: Again work out difference between the life expectancy of the Boroughs compared to the national average Round the whole table based on if the column is numeric (this isnt required and were not adding a new column). Here we are using across that applies some kind of transformation across the columns selected (or that are numeric in this case). Round the column UKdiff to 0 decimcal places (not adding a new column) Use case_when() to find Boroughs that have an average age of equal to or over 81 and create a new column that containts text based combining equal or above UK average by then the years created in UKdiff. We do this through the str_c() function from the stringr pacakge that lets us join two or more vector elements into a single character vector. Here sep determines how these two vectors are separated. Then group by the UKcompare column Finally, count the number in each group. Life_expectancy3 &lt;- Life_expectancy %&gt;% mutate(UKdiff = averagelifeexpectancy-81.16)%&gt;% mutate(across(is.numeric, round, 3))%&gt;% mutate(across(UKdiff, round, 0))%&gt;% mutate(UKcompare = case_when(averagelifeexpectancy &gt;= 81 ~ str_c(&quot;equal or above UK average by&quot;, UKdiff, &quot;years&quot;, sep=&quot; &quot;), TRUE ~ str_c(&quot;below UK average by&quot;, UKdiff, &quot;years&quot;, sep=&quot; &quot;)))%&gt;% group_by(UKcompare)%&gt;% summarise(count=n()) ## Warning: Predicate functions must be wrapped in `where()`. ## ## # Bad ## data %&gt;% select(is.numeric) ## ## # Good ## data %&gt;% select(where(is.numeric)) ## ## i Please update your code. ## This message is displayed once per session. ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) Life_expectancy3 ## # A tibble: 7 x 2 ## UKcompare count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 below UK average by -1 years 3 ## 2 below UK average by 0 years 5 ## 3 equal or above UK average by 0 years 4 ## 4 equal or above UK average by 1 years 12 ## 5 equal or above UK average by 2 years 4 ## 6 equal or above UK average by 3 years 4 ## 7 equal or above UK average by 5 years 1 There is a lot of information here that we could use and make into a plot or map. For example, the Borough count of life expectancy difference could be visualised in a histogram (covered next week). Or, we could map the difference between the average life expectancy of each London Borough compared to the UK average..to do this would can just reuse some of the code from the example above. Life_expectancy4 &lt;- Life_expectancy %&gt;% mutate(UKdiff = averagelifeexpectancy-81.16)%&gt;% mutate(across(is.numeric, round, 3))%&gt;% mutate(across(UKdiff, round, 0)) Before you move on consider what you have learnt about dplyr in relation to this concept map by Greg Wilson. The teaching team will also explain it 2.5.6 Plotting For a simple and quick plot, we can use the plot() function plot(LondonBoroughs$male_life_expectancy_2009_13, LondonBoroughs$percent_children_in_reception_year_who_are_obese_2011_12_to_2013_14) 2.5.7 Pimp my graph! Now, of course, because this is R, we can pimp this graph using something a bit more fancy than the base graphics functions. Here we will use plotly an open source interactive graphing library install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;) library(plotly) plot_ly(LondonBoroughs, #data for x axis x = ~male_life_expectancy_2009_13, #data for y axis y = ~percent_children_in_reception_year_who_are_obese_2011_12_to_2013_14, #attribute to display when hovering text = ~borough, type = &quot;scatter&quot;, mode = &quot;markers&quot;) 2.5.8 Spatial Data in R This next part of the practical applies the same principles introduced above to the much more complex problem of handling spatial data within R. In the remainder of this practical we will produce a map, the focus here is getting to grips with some of Rs visulisation tools and not sound analysis (I know one is useless without the other!). Good quality spatial analysis will come in the rest of the module. Whilst the instructions are step by step you are encouraged to start deviating from them (trying different colours for example) to get a better understanding of what we are doing. The first package we need to install for this part of the practical is maptools  either find and install it using the RStudio GUI or do the following: install.packages(&quot;maptools&quot;) There are a few other packages well need to get to grips with. Some, like ggplot2 (one of the most influential R packages ever) are part of the tidyverse package we came across earlier. Others we will need to install for the first time. install.packages(c(&quot;classInt&quot;, &quot;tmap&quot;)) # might also need these ones install.packages(c(&quot;RColorBrewer&quot;, &quot;sp&quot;, &quot;rgeos&quot;, &quot;tmaptools&quot;, &quot;sf&quot;, &quot;downloader&quot;, &quot;rgdal&quot;, &quot;geojsonio&quot;)) Now that the packages have been installed you will not have to repeat the above steps again (when you use your account in these cluster rooms). Open a new script and save it to your working directory as wk2_maps.r. As before, type each of the lines of code into this window and then select and use the ctrl return keys to run them. Be sure to save your script often. The first task is to load the packages we have just installed. Note, you might have some issues with the OpenStreetMap package if your installation of java on your computer doesnt match your installation of R  e.g. if you have installed the 64bit version of R, you also need the 64bit version of java (same with the 32bit versions)  you may also need to install the package Rcpp separately and try again. Install Java 64-bit from: https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp #Load Packages (ignore any error messages about being built under a #different R version): library(maptools) library(RColorBrewer) library(classInt) library(sp) library(rgeos) library(tmap) library(tmaptools) library(sf) library(rgdal) library(geojsonio) 2.5.8.1 Background to spatial data in R R has a very well developed ecosystem of packages for working with Spatial Data. Early pioneers like Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma along with various colleagues were instrumental in writing packages to interface with some powerful open source libraries for working with spatial data, such as GDAL and GEOS. These were accessed via the rgdal and rgeos packages. The maptools package by Roger Bivand, amongst other things, allowed Shapefiles to be read into R. The sp package (along with spdep) by Edzer Pebesma was very important for defining a series of classes and methods for spatial data natively in R which then allowed others to write software to work with these formats. Other packages like raster advanced the analysis of gridded spatial data, while packages like classInt and RColorbrewer facilitated the binning of data and colouring of choropleth maps. Whilst these packages were extremely important for advancing spatial data analysis in R, they were not always the most straightforward to use  making a map in R could take quite a lot of effort and they were static and visually basic. However, more recently new packages have arrived to change this. Now leaflet enables R to interface with the leaflet javascript library for online, dynamic maps. ggplot2 which was developed by Hadley Wickham and colleagues radically changed the way that people thought about and created graphical objects in R, including maps, and introduced a graphical style which has been the envy of other software to the extent that there are now libraries in Python which copy the ggplot2 style! Building on all of these, the new tmap (Thematic Map) package has changed the game completely and now enables us to read, write and manipulate spatial data and produce visually impressive and interactive maps, very easily. In parallel, the sf (Simple Features) package is helping us re-think the way that spatial data can be stored and manipulated. Its exciting times for geographic information / spatial data science! 2.5.8.2 Making some choropleth maps Choropleth maps are thematic maps which colour areas according to some phenomenon. In our case, we are going to fill some irregular polygons (the London Boroughs) with a colour that corresponds to a particular attribute. As with all plots in R, there are multiple ways we can do this. The basic plot() function requires no data preparation but additional effort in colour selection/ adding the map key etc. Quick plot (qplot()) and ggplot() (installed in the ggplot2 package, part of the tidyverse) require some additional steps to format the spatial data but select colours and add keys etc automatically. Qplot is basically a shortcut for a quick map / plot, but if you have a lot of data use ggplot(). However, here, we are going to make use of the new tmap package which makes making maps very easy indeed. More on tmap when we start mapping.. So one mega cool thing about R is you can read spatial data in straight from the internetz! Try this below for downloading a GeoJson fileit might take a few minutes EW &lt;- st_read(&quot;https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8edafbe3276d4b56aec60991cbddda50_2.geojson&quot;) ## Reading layer `Local_Authority_Districts__December_2015__Boundaries&#39; from data source `https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8edafbe3276d4b56aec60991cbddda50_2.geojson&#39; using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 380 features and 6 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -8.649996 ymin: 49.86463 xmax: 1.768937 ymax: 60.86079 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 Or you can do a manual download from the Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal via Download &gt; Shapefile. Pull out London using the str_detect() function from the stringr package in combination with filter() from dplyr (again!). We will look for the bit of the district code that relates to London (E09) from the lad15cd column data frame of our sf object. LondonMap&lt;- EW %&gt;% filter(str_detect(lad15cd, &quot;^E09&quot;)) #plot it using the base plot function qtm(LondonMap) Of course, we can also read in our data from a shapefile stored in a local directory: #read the shapefile into a simple features object BoroughMapSF &lt;- st_read(&quot;prac1_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london/ESRI/London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&quot;) #plot it very quickly usking qtm (quick thematic map) to check #it has been read in correctly qtm(BoroughMapSF) 2.5.8.3 Attribute data OK, enough messing around, show us the maps!! Hold your horses, before be can create a map, we need to join some attribute data to some boundaries, lets do it with merge(), but first clean up all of our names with Janitor again. LondonData &lt;- clean_names(LondonData) #EW is the data we read in straight from the web BoroughDataMap &lt;- EW %&gt;% clean_names()%&gt;% # the . here just means use the data already loaded filter(str_detect(lad15cd, &quot;^E09&quot;))%&gt;% merge(., LondonData, by.x=&quot;lad15cd&quot;, by.y=&quot;new_code&quot;, no.dups = TRUE)%&gt;% distinct(.,lad15cd, .keep_all = TRUE) Weve added some more arguments to distinct() that mean we only have unique rows based on the code, but we keep all other variables .keep_all=TRUE. If you change to .keep_all=FALSE (which is the default) then all the other variables will be removed. An alternative to merge() would be to use a left_join() (like in SQL)but its the same thing as merge(). Figure 2.1: Taken from Tidy explain by Garrick Aden-Buie BoroughDataMap2 &lt;- EW %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% filter(str_detect(lad15cd, &quot;^E09&quot;))%&gt;% left_join(., LondonData, by = c(&quot;lad15cd&quot; = &quot;new_code&quot;)) If there are mutliple matches then all hits are returned Figure 2.2: Taken from Tidy explain by Garrick Aden-Buie However, ive left out filter() and distinct() which you would need to reduce the data to London and remove the duplicate City of London row afterwardslike in the step before with merge and as we did earlier on in the session. 2.5.9 Simple mapping tmap follows the idea of the grammar of graphics, similar to dplyr being the grammar of data manipulation. Essentially with the grammar of graphics the main data being mapped defines the location somewhere on Earth (loaded with tm_shape). Map aesthetics are then defined with a +, these usually include tm_fill() (fill of the polygons based on a variable) + tm_borders() (border of polygons). However, tm_polygon basically combines tm_fill() and tm_borders() So to conclude, data first then + aesthetic syntax. Were going to create a simple map with our spatial data, mapping and cartographic practice are covered in much more detail later in the course, but for now We can create a choropleth map very quickly now using qtm() as weve done before library(tmap) library(tmaptools) tmap_mode(&quot;plot&quot;) ## tmap mode set to plotting qtm(BoroughDataMap, fill = &quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015&quot;) But thats a bit basic! How about adding a basemapto get a basemap we need to extract it from OpenStreetMap (OSM) using the read_osm() function from the tmaptools package. We talk about this in later weeks, but its a free editable map of the World (the Wikipedia of maps). We are going to need to create a box (termed bounding box) around London using the st_box() function from the sf package to extract the basemap image (which is a raster). tmaplondon &lt;- BoroughDataMap %&gt;% st_bbox(.) %&gt;% tmaptools::read_osm(., type = &quot;osm&quot;, zoom = NULL) Now we have the basemap, set tmap to plot, add the basemap, add the shape (our London layer), tell it which attribute to map (job seekers), the style to make the colour divisions (we explain this more in later weeks), the transparency (alpha), compass, scale and legend. But remember what i explained earlier data first then + aesthetic syntax. We can also double up on this, so below we have data data from our bounding box + its raster aesthetic (tm_rgb) THEN ALSO the data from our London Borough layer and its aesthetics. As they are the same place they plot over each other! There is a bit of extra code below that we havent explained: style  how to divide the data into out colour breaks palette  the colour scheme to use tmap_mode(&quot;plot&quot;) tm_shape(ftmaplondon)+ tm_rgb()+ tm_shape(BoroughDataMap) + tm_polygons(&quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015&quot;, style=&quot;jenks&quot;, palette=&quot;YlOrBr&quot;, midpoint=NA, title=&quot;Rate per 1,000 people&quot;, alpha = 0.5) + tm_compass(position = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;),type = &quot;arrow&quot;) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_layout(title = &quot;Job seekers&#39; Allowance Claimants&quot;, legend.position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) So thats our first real map done! Awesome work. But remember our Life_expectancy4 data that we wrangled earlier. Can you think of a way to map this? So we need to Merge our Life_expectancy4map with the spatial data EW Map our merge with tmap Life_expectancy4map &lt;- EW %&gt;% merge(., Life_expectancy4, by.x=&quot;lad15cd&quot;, by.y=&quot;new_code&quot;, no.dups = TRUE)%&gt;% distinct(.,lad15cd, .keep_all = TRUE) Now lets make the map! tmap_mode(&quot;plot&quot;) ## tmap mode set to plotting tm_shape(tmaplondon)+ tm_rgb()+ tm_shape(Life_expectancy4map) + tm_polygons(&quot;UKdiff&quot;, style=&quot;pretty&quot;, palette=&quot;Blues&quot;, midpoint=NA, title=&quot;Number of years&quot;, alpha = 0.5) + tm_compass(position = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;),type = &quot;arrow&quot;) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;left&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) + tm_layout(title = &quot;Difference in life expectancy&quot;, legend.position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) There are a few subtle differences in the code of this second map if you look closely: * Style is now pretty not jenks. Style controls where the breaks are within the data that are then assigned to each colour for mapping. pretty rounds to whole numbers and evenly spaces them over the data. * Palette in now Blues not YlOrBr. Palette controls the colour of the map, you can see more options through tmaptools::palette_explorer() 2.6 Tidying data As you progress through the programme you will probably notice that there is pretty much a tool or function for anything you could want. However, there has been little reserach into creating a standardised approach for wrangling data into a common format for analysis. This is where Hadley Wickhams tidy data comes in. As per the R for Data Science book, tidy data is defined using the following three rules: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. But, as per the book, these three requirements are interrelated as you cant only adhere to two without adhering to all three. So this gives us: Put each dataset in a tibble Put each variable in a column Figure 2.3: This figure is taken directly from Grolemund and Wickham (2017) Chapter 12.Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells. However, i also find this example from KSK analytics very helpful.. Figure 2.4: This figure is taken directly from Grolemund and Wickham (2017) Chapter 12.Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells. Earlier we read in the data using: flytipping &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/fly-tipping-incidents/536278ff-a391-4f20-bc79-9e705c9b3ec0/fly-tipping-borough.csv&quot;) But we can also do something like this to force the columns to the appopraite data types (e.g. text, numberic) flytipping1 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/fly-tipping-incidents/536278ff-a391-4f20-bc79-9e705c9b3ec0/fly-tipping-borough.csv&quot;, col_types = cols( code = col_character(), area = col_character(), year = col_character(), total_incidents = col_number(), total_action_taken = col_number(), warning_letters = col_number(), fixed_penalty_notices = col_number(), statutory_notices = col_number(), formal_cautions = col_number(), injunctions = col_number(), prosecutions = col_number() )) # view the data view(flytipping1) So we have a tibble with columns of each varaible (e.g. warning letters, total actions taken) where every row is a London borough. We want make sure that each observation has its own rowit doesnt as in the first row here we have observations for total incidents and total actions taken etcto do this we will use pivot_longer(). Make sure you have the most recent version of tidyverse if you get an error. #convert the tibble into a tidy tibble flytipping_long &lt;- flytipping1 %&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = 4:11, names_to = &quot;tipping_type&quot;, values_to = &quot;count&quot; ) # view the data view(flytipping_long) Do you see the difference..the data has become longer!this is classed as tidy data as every variable has a column, every observation has a row and every value has a cell. You could also use this to do the same thing #an alternative which just pulls everything out into a single table flytipping2 &lt;- flytipping1[,1:4] But my advice would be to learn how to use the tidy tools! Now lets make it a bit more suitable for mapping with pivot_wider() by making coloumns for each year of each variable.in the original .csv we had a year coloumn that had values of 2011-2012 to 2017-2018, so if we wanted to map a specifc year wed have to filter out the year then map. Here we can just alter the data from pivot_longer() using the year and tipping type Note, just because the data is considered tidy doesnt mean it is directly appropriate for mapping. It might need to be tidy for analysis. #pivot the tidy tibble into one that is suitable for mapping flytipping_wide &lt;- flytipping_long %&gt;% pivot_wider( id_cols = 1:2, names_from = c(year,tipping_type), names_sep = &quot;_&quot;, values_from = count ) view(flytipping_wide) But what if you were just interested in a specific varaible and wanted the coloums to be each year of the dataagain using pivot_wider() widefly &lt;- flytipping2 %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = year, values_from = total_incidents) You could now join this to the London borough .shp and produce a map For another quick worked example have a look at the RLadies Sydney blog post on pivoting Whats the take home from this? Basically always try to put your data into a certain format before doing further analysis on it as it will be easier for you to determine the right tools to select. 2.7 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form.

Can you make an accurate map by SciShow Remember this is just a starting point, explore the reading list, practical and lecture for more ideas. 3.3 Recommended listening  Some of these practicals are long, take regular breaks and have a listen to some of our fav tunes each week. Andy Adam  this week, from me, its a history lesson. 30 Years ago, two DJs started playing tunes in the other room in Heaven, just under Charing Cross Station. The night was called Rage and the DJs were called Fabio and Grooverider. Their mix of house and sped-up breakbeats was an entirely new sound that began to be called Jungle. The 30 Years of Rage album recalls some of the early tunes that helped shape an entire genre of music. Enjoy! 3.4 Introduction This practical is composed of four parts. To start with were going to explore projection systems in more detail. In the second part we will load some global raster data into R. In the third part we extract data points (cities and towns) from this data and generate some descriptive statistics and histograms. In the final section we explore interpolation using point data. 3.5 Part 1 projections Projections systems are mathematical formulas that specify how our data is represented on a map. These can either be call geographic coordiate reference systems or projected coordinate reference systems. The former treats data as a sphere and the latter as a flat object. You might come across phrases such as a resolution of 5 minutes or a resolution of 30 metres, which can be used to establish what kind of projection system has been used. Let me explain A minute type of resolution (e.g. 5 minute resolution) is a geographic reference system that treats the globe as if it was a sphere divided into 360 equal parts called degrees (which are angular units). Each degree has 60 minutes and each minute has 60 seconds. Arc-seconds of latitude (horizontal lines in the globe figure below) remain almost constant whilst arc-seconds of longitude (vertical lines in the globe figure below) decrease in a trigonometric cosine-based fashion as you move towards the Earths poles. This causes problems as you increase or decrease latitude the longitudial lengths alterFor example at the equator (0°, such as Quito) a degree is 111.3 km whereas at 60° (such as Saint Petersburg) a degree is 55.80 km In contrast a projected coordinate system is defined on a flat, two-dimensional plane (through projecting a spheriod onto a 2D surface) giving it constant lengths, angles and areas Figure 3.1: This figure is taken directly from Lovelace et al. (2019) section 2.2. Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). The left plot represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0° longitude and latitude. The right plot represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula. Knowing this, if we want to conduct analysis locally (e.g. at a national level) or use metric (e.g. kilometres) measurements we need to be able to change the projection of our data or reproject it. Most countries and even states have their own projected coordinate reference system such as British National Grid in the above exampleNote how the origin (0,0) is has moved from the centre of the Earth to the bottom South West corner of the UK, which has now been ironed (or flattened) out. Projection rules Units are angular (e.g. degrees, latitude and longitude) or the data is global = Geographic coordinate reference system Units are linear (e.g. feet, metres) or data is at a local level (e.g. national, well the last one is not always true, but likely) = Projected coordinate reference system. You might hear some key words about projections that could terrify you! Lets break them down: Ellipsoid (or spheriod) = size of shape of the Earth (3d) Datum = contains the point relationship (where the origin (0,0) of the map is) between a Cartesian coordinates (flat surface) and Earths surface. They can be local or geocentric. They set the origin, the scale and orientation of the Coordiante Reference System (CRS). Local datum = changes the Ellispoid to align with a certain location on the surface (e.g. BNG that uses the OSGB36 datum). A local datum is anything that isnt the centre of the Earth. Geocentric datum = the centre is equal to the Earths centre of gravity (e.g. WGS84). Coordinate reference system (CRS) = Formula that defines how the 2D map (e.g. on your screen or a paper map) relates to the 3D Earth. Also sometimes called a spatial Reference System (SRS) Take home message When you do analysis on multiple datasets make sure they are all use the same Coordiante Reference System. If its local (e.g. city of country analysis) then use a local projected CRS where possible. 3.5.1 Changing projections 3.5.1.1 Vector Until now, weve not really considered how our maps have been printed to the screen. Later on in the practical we will explore gridded temperature in Australia, as we will need an outline of Australia lets use that as an example here: First, we need to source and load a vector of Australia. Go to: https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html and download the GeoPackage Once weve downloaded the .gpkg lets see what is inside it with st_layers() library(sf) library(here) st_layers(here(&quot;prac3_data&quot;, &quot;gadm36_AUS.gpkg&quot;)) ## Driver: GPKG ## Available layers: ## layer_name geometry_type features fields ## 1 gadm36_AUS_0 Multi Polygon 1 2 ## 2 gadm36_AUS_1 Multi Polygon 11 10 ## 3 gadm36_AUS_2 Multi Polygon 569 13 Then read in the GeoPackage layer for the whole of Australia (layer ending in 0) library(sf) Ausoutline &lt;- st_read(here(&quot;prac3_data&quot;, &quot;gadm36_AUS.gpkg&quot;), layer=&#39;gadm36_AUS_0&#39;) ## Reading layer `gadm36_AUS_0&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\prac3_data\\gadm36_AUS.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 112.9211 ymin: -55.11694 xmax: 159.1092 ymax: -9.142176 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 You can check that the coordinate reference systems of sf or sp objects using the print function: print(Ausoutline) ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 112.9211 ymin: -55.11694 xmax: 159.1092 ymax: -9.142176 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 ## GID_0 NAME_0 geom ## 1 AUS Australia MULTIPOLYGON (((158.6928 -5... The coordinates stored in the geometry column of your sf object contain the information to enable points, lines or polygons to be drawn on the screen. You can see that our Ausoutline is a multipolygon and every point within the polygon will have coordinates that are in a certain reference system, here WGS 84. 3.5.1.2 Proj4 WGS84 is one of the most common global projection systems, used in nearly all GPS devices. Whilst we were able to identify the CRS of our layer using print another alternative is to find the proj4 string. A proj4 string is meant to be a compact way of identifying a coordinate reference system. Lets extract ours library(sf) st_crs(Ausoutline)$proj4string ## [1] &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs&quot; Well thats clear as mud! I hear you cry! Yes, not obvious is it!. The proj4-string basically tells the computer where on the earth to locate the coordinates that make up the geometries in your file and what distortions to apply (i.e. if to flatten it out completely etc.) Its composed of a list of parameters seperated by a +. Here are projection proj uses latitude and longitude (so its a geographic not projected CRS). The datum is WGS84 that uses Earths centre mass as the coordinate origin (0,0). The Coordiante systems in R chapter by Gimond (2019) provides much more information on Proj4. However, id advise trying to use EPSG codes, which we come onto next. Sometimes you can download data from the web and it doesnt have a CRS. If any boundary data you download does not have a coordinate reference system attached to it (NA is displayed in the coord. ref section), this is not a huge problem  it can be added afterwards by adding the proj4string to the file or just assigning an EPSG code. To find the proj4-strings for a whole range of different geographic projections, use the search facility at http://spatialreference.org/ or http://epsg.io/. 3.5.1.3 EPSG Now, if you can store a whole proj4-string in your mind, you must be some kind of savant (why are you doing this course? you could make your fortune as a card-counting poker player or something!). The rest of us need something a little bit more easy to remember and for coordinate reference systems, the saviour is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)  (naturally!). Now managed and maintained by the International Association of Oil and Gas producers  EPSG codes are short numbers represent all coordinate reference systems in the world and link directly to proj4 strings. We saw these last week in the [Making some maps] section. The EPSG code for the WGS84 World Geodetic System (usually the default CRS for most spatial data) is 4326  http://epsg.io/4326 If our Australian outline didnt have a spatial reference system, we could have just set it using st_set_crs() Ausoutline &lt;- Ausoutline %&gt;% st_set_crs(., 43260) Or, more conciselybut remember this is only useful if there is no CRS when you load the data. #or more concisely Ausoutline &lt;- st_read(here(&quot;prac3_data&quot;, &quot;gadm36_AUS.gpkg&quot;), layer=&#39;gadm36_AUS_0&#39;) %&gt;% st_set_crs(4326) ## Reading layer `gadm36_AUS_0&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\prac3_data\\gadm36_AUS.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 112.9211 ymin: -55.11694 xmax: 159.1092 ymax: -9.142176 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 Normally if a layer has a missing CRS, its WGS84. But check for any metadata that might list it. 3.5.1.4 Reprojecting your spatial data Reprojecting your data is something that you might have to (or want to) do, on occasion. Why? Well, one example might be if you want to measure the distance of a line object, or the distance between two polygons. This can be done far more easily in a projected coordinate system (where the units are measured in metres) than it can a geographic coordinate system such as WGS84 (where the units are degrees). However for generating maps in packages like leaflet, your maps will need to be in WGS84, rather than a projected (flat) reference system . So once your data has a coordinates system to work with, we can re-project or transform to anything we like. For SF objects, like our outline of Australia its carried out using st_transform. Here we are changing from WGS84 to GDA94, which is a local CRS for Australia and has the EPSG code 3112.

In the SF object, you can compare the values in the geometry column with those in the original file to look at how they have changed You might also encounter an SP object from the sp package. In this case id advise just transforming the sp object to sf and changing the projection.this was covered last week..but its here too #From sf to sp AusoutlineSP &lt;- Ausoutline %&gt;% as(., &quot;Spatial&quot;) #From sp to sf AusoutlineSF &lt;- AusoutlineSP %&gt;% st_as_sf() If you are still a bit confused by coordiate reference systems then stop and take some time to have a look at the resources listed here. It is very important to understand projection systems. This is the best resources ive come across explaining coordiate reference systems are: Geographic projection and transformation workbook by Robin Lovelace I hate coordinate systems ESRIs coordinate systems and projections for beginners The story of Mercator! 3.5.2 WorldClim data So far weve only really considered vector data. Within the rest of this practical we will explore some raster data sources and processing techniques. If you recall rasters are grids of cell with individual values. There are many, many possible sources to obtain raster data from as it is the data type used for the majority (basically all) of remote sensing data. We are going to use WorldClim data  this is a dataset of free global climate layers (rasters) with a spatial resolution of between 1\\(km^2\\) and 240\\(km^2\\). Download the data from: https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html Select any variable you want at the 5 minute second resolution. Unzip and move the data to your project folder. Now load the data. We could do this individually. library(raster) jan&lt;-raster(here(&quot;prac3_data&quot;, &quot;wc2.0_5m_tavg_01.tif&quot;)) # have a look at the raster layer jan jan ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 2160, 4320, 9331200 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -90, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## source : C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo/prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_01.tif ## names : wc2.0_5m_tavg_01 ## values : -46.697, 34.291 (min, max) Then have a quick look at the data, we can see its again in the geographic projection of WGS84. plot(jan) To reproject a raster the whole grid must be recomputed (for a vector is was just the individual coordinates of the shapes), and the attributes then reestimated to the new grid. To do this we have to use projectRaster() from the Raster package. However, sadly it only accepts PROJ4 strings. Now we can actually see some datahere is a quick example of using the Mollweide projection saved to a new object. The Mollweide projection retains area proportions whilst compromising accuracy of angle and shape # set the proj 4 to a new object newproj&lt;-&quot;+proj=moll +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs&quot; # get the jan raster and give it the new proj4 pr1 &lt;- jan %&gt;% projectRaster(., crs=newproj) plot(pr1) It is possible to use only an EPSG code within a PROJ4 string, however, certain projections dont have an EPSG code. For example, if we just wanted to go back from Mollweide to WGS84 we can simply set the crs to \"+init=epsg:4326\" pr1 &lt;- pr1 %&gt;% projectRaster(., crs=&quot;+init=epsg:4326&quot;) plot(pr1) 3.5.3 WorldClim data loading efficiently Ok, projections over. Lets move forward with the practical A better and more efficient way is to firstly list all the files stored within our directory with dir_info from the fs pacakge, then use dplyr in conjunction with str_detect() from stringr to search for filenames containing tif. Finally just select the paths. But lets firstly explore what dir_info() does # look in our folder, find the files that end with .tif and library(fs) dir_info(&quot;prac3_data/&quot;) ## # A tibble: 16 x 18 ## path type size permissions modification_time user group ## &lt;fs::path&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fs::b&gt; &lt;fs::perms&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 prac3_dat~ file 83.57M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:37 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 prac3_dat~ dire~ 0 rw- 2020-06-05 17:57:56 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 prac3_dat~ file 300 rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:37 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 prac3_dat~ file 256 rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:37 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 prac3_dat~ file 8.78M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 prac3_dat~ file 8.92M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 prac3_dat~ file 9.03M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 prac3_dat~ file 9.09M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 prac3_dat~ file 9.12M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 prac3_dat~ file 9.04M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 11 prac3_dat~ file 8.98M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 12 prac3_dat~ file 8.95M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 13 prac3_dat~ file 9.02M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 14 prac3_dat~ file 8.99M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 15 prac3_dat~ file 8.86M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 16 prac3_dat~ file 8.77M rw- 2020-04-08 12:04:38 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## # ... with 11 more variables: device_id &lt;dbl&gt;, hard_links &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # special_device_id &lt;dbl&gt;, inode &lt;dbl&gt;, block_size &lt;dbl&gt;, blocks &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # flags &lt;int&gt;, generation &lt;dbl&gt;, access_time &lt;dttm&gt;, change_time &lt;dttm&gt;, ## # birth_time &lt;dttm&gt; Essentailly it just gets the details you would normally see in the file explorer..however, we can use this data with dplyr to select the data we actually want. Now be careful! the function select() exists both within the dplyr and raster package so to make sure you use the right one dplyr::select forces select from dplyr. library(tidyverse) listfiles&lt;-dir_info(&quot;prac3_data/&quot;) %&gt;% filter(str_detect(path, &quot;.tif&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull() #have a look at the file names listfiles ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_01.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_02.tif ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_03.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_04.tif ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_05.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_06.tif ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_07.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_08.tif ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_09.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_10.tif ## prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_11.tif prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_12.tif Here, were also using pull() from dplyr which is the same as the $ often used to extract columns as in the next stage the input must be filenames as characters (nothing else like a column name). Then load all of the data straight into a raster stack. A raster stack is a collection of raster layers with the same spatial extent and resolution. worldclimtemp &lt;- listfiles %&gt;% stack() #have a look at the raster stack worldclimtemp ## class : RasterStack ## dimensions : 2160, 4320, 9331200, 12 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -90, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## names : wc2.0_5m_tavg_01, wc2.0_5m_tavg_02, wc2.0_5m_tavg_03, wc2.0_5m_tavg_04, wc2.0_5m_tavg_05, wc2.0_5m_tavg_06, wc2.0_5m_tavg_07, wc2.0_5m_tavg_08, wc2.0_5m_tavg_09, wc2.0_5m_tavg_10, wc2.0_5m_tavg_11, wc2.0_5m_tavg_12 ## min values : -46.697, -44.559, -57.107, -62.996, -63.541, -63.096, -66.785, -64.600, -62.600, -54.400, -42.000, -45.340 ## max values : 34.291, 33.174, 33.904, 34.629, 36.312, 38.400, 43.036, 41.073, 36.389, 33.869, 33.518, 33.667 In the raster stack youll notice that under dimensions there are 12 layers (nlayers). The stack has loaded the 12 months of average temperature data for us in order. To access single layers within the stack: # access the january layer worldclimtemp[[1]] ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 2160, 4320, 9331200 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -90, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## source : C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo/prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_01.tif ## names : wc2.0_5m_tavg_01 ## values : -46.697, 34.291 (min, max) We can also rename our layers within the stack: month &lt;- c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;, &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;) names(worldclimtemp) &lt;- month Last week we used rename() from the dplyr package, however, this isnt yet available for raster data  Now to get data for just January use our new layer name worldclimtemp$Jan ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 2160, 4320, 9331200 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -90, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## source : C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo/prac3_data/wc2.0_5m_tavg_01.tif ## names : Jan ## values : -46.697, 34.291 (min, max) 3.5.4 Location data from a raster Using a raster stack we can extract data with a single command!! For example lets make a dataframe of some sample sites  Australian cities/towns. site &lt;- c(&quot;Brisbane&quot;, &quot;Melbourne&quot;, &quot;Perth&quot;, &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Broome&quot;, &quot;Darwin&quot;, &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Bunbury&quot;, &quot;Cairns&quot;, &quot;Adelaide&quot;, &quot;Gold Coast&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;Newcastle&quot;, &quot;Wollongong&quot;, &quot;Logan City&quot; ) lon &lt;- c(153.03, 144.96, 115.86, 151.21, 122.23, 130.84, 149.10, 115.64, 145.77, 138.6, 153.43, 149.13, 151.78, 150.89, 153.12) lat &lt;- c(-27.47, -37.91, -31.95, -33.87, 17.96, -12.46, -33.28, -33.33, -16.92, -34.93, -28, -35.28, -32.93, -34.42, -27.64) #Put all of this inforamtion into one list samples &lt;- data.frame(site, lon, lat, row.names=&quot;site&quot;) # Extract the data from the Rasterstack for all points AUcitytemp&lt;- raster::extract(worldclimtemp, samples) Add the city names to the rows of AUcitytemp Aucitytemp2 &lt;- AUcitytemp %&gt;% as_tibble()%&gt;% add_column(Site = site, .before = &quot;Jan&quot;) 3.6 Part 2 descriptive statistics Descriptive (or summary) statistics provide a summary of our data, often forming the base of quantitiatve analysis leading to inferential statistics which we use to make infereces about our data (e.g. judegements of the probability that the observed difference between two datasets is not by chance) 3.6.1 Data preparation Lets take Perth as an example. We can subset our data either using the row name: Perthtemp &lt;- Aucitytemp2 %&gt;% filter(site==&quot;Perth&quot;) Or the row location: Perthtemp &lt;- Aucitytemp2[3,] 3.6.2 Histogram A histogram lets us see the frequency of distribution of our data. Make a histogram of Perths temperature. The tibble stored the data as double and the base hist() function needs it as numeric.. hist(as.numeric(Perthtemp)) ## Warning in hist(as.numeric(Perthtemp)): NAs introduced by coercion Remember what were looking at here. The x axis is the temperature and the y is the frequency of occurrence. Thats a pretty simple histogram, lets improve the aesthetics a bit. #define where you want the breaks in the historgram userbreak&lt;-c(8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26) hist(as.numeric(Perthtemp), breaks=userbreak, col=&quot;red&quot;, main=&quot;Histogram of Perth Temperature&quot;, xlab=&quot;Temperature&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency&quot;) ## Warning in hist(as.numeric(Perthtemp), breaks = userbreak, col = &quot;red&quot;, : NAs ## introduced by coercion Check out the histogram information R generated histinfo &lt;- Perthtemp %&gt;% as.numeric()%&gt;% hist(.) histinfo ## $breaks ## [1] 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 ## ## $counts ## [1] 1 3 2 2 1 1 2 ## ## $density ## [1] 0.04166667 0.12500000 0.08333333 0.08333333 0.04166667 0.04166667 0.08333333 ## ## $mids ## [1] 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 ## ## $xname ## [1] &quot;.&quot; ## ## $equidist ## [1] TRUE ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;histogram&quot; Here we have: breaks  the cut off points for the bins (or bars), we just specified these counts  the number of cells in each bin midpoints  the middle value for each bin density  the density of data per bin 3.6.3 Using more data This was still a rather basic histogram, what if we wanted to see the distribution of temperatures for the whole of Australia in Jan (from averaged WorldClim data) as opposed to just our point for Perth. Here, we will use the outline of Australia we loaded earlier.. Check the layer by plotting the geometrywe could do this through plot(Ausoutline$geom) But as the .shp is quite complex (i.e. lots of points) we can simplify it first with the rmapshaper package  install that now..if it doesnt load (or crashes your PC) this isnt an issue. Its just good practice that when you load data into R you check to see what it looks like #load the rmapshaper package library(rmapshaper) #simplify the shapefile #keep specifies the % of points #to keep AusoutSIMPLE&lt;-Ausoutline %&gt;% ms_simplify(.,keep=0.05) plot(AusoutSIMPLE$geom) This should load quicker, but for publication or best analysis (i.e. not just demonstrating or testing) id recommend using the real file to ensure you dont simply a potentially important variable. Check out the rmapshaper vignette for more information Next, set our map extent (where we want to clip the data to) to the outline of Australia then crop our WorldClim dataset to it. HOWEVER, we need to make sure that both of our layers are in the same coordinate reference system when we combine themso.. print(Ausoutline) ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 112.9211 ymin: -55.11694 xmax: 159.1092 ymax: -9.142176 ## geographic CRS: WGS 84 ## GID_0 NAME_0 geom ## 1 AUS Australia MULTIPOLYGON (((158.6928 -5... #this works nicely for rasters crs(worldclimtemp) ## CRS arguments: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs Perfect! Now lets contiune Austemp &lt;- Ausoutline %&gt;% # now crop our temp data to the extent crop(worldclimtemp,.) # plot the output plot(Austemp) Youll notice that whilst we have the whole of Australia the raster hasnt been perfectly clipped to the exact outline.the extent just specifies an extent box that will cover the whole of the shape. If want to just get raster data within the outline of the shape: exactAus &lt;- Austemp %&gt;% mask(.,Ausoutline, na.rm=TRUE) You could also run this using the original worldclimtemp raster, however, it may take some time. Id recommend cropping to the extent first. Both our Austemp and exactAus are raster bricks. A brick is similar to a stack except it is now stored as one file instead of a collection. Lets re-compute our histogram for Australia in March. We could just use hist like we have done before. We can either subset using the location (we know March is thrid in the RasterBrick). #subset using the known location of the raster hist(exactAus[[3]], col=&quot;red&quot;, main =&quot;March temperature&quot;) We can also subset based on the name of the Brick, sadly we cant apply filter() from dplyr (like we did earlier when filtering Perth) yet to rasters #OR #subset with the word Mar hist(raster::subset(exactAus, &quot;Mar&quot;), col=&quot;red&quot;, main =&quot;March temperature&quot;) However we have a bit more control with ggplot() 3.6.4 Histogram with ggplot We need to make our raster into a data.frame to be compatible with ggplot2, using a dataframe or tibble exactAusdf &lt;- exactAus %&gt;% as.data.frame() library(ggplot2) # set up the basic histogram gghist &lt;- ggplot(exactAusdf, aes(x=Mar)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;white&quot;)+ labs(title=&quot;Ggplot2 histogram of Australian March temperatures&quot;, x=&quot;Temperature&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;) # add a vertical line to the hisogram showing mean tempearture gghist + geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(Mar, na.rm=TRUE)), color=&quot;blue&quot;, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, size=1)+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) How about plotting multiple months of temperature data on the same histogram As we did in practical 2, we need to put our variaible (months) into a one coloumn using pivot_longer(). Here, we are saying select columns 1-12 (all the months) and place them in a new column called Month and their values in another called Temp squishdata&lt;-exactAusdf%&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = 1:12, names_to = &quot;Month&quot;, values_to = &quot;Temp&quot; ) Then subset the data, selecting two months using filter() from dplyr twomonths &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% # | = OR filter(., Month==&quot;Jan&quot; | Month==&quot;Jun&quot;) Get the mean for each month we selected, remember group_by() and summarise() from last week? meantwomonths &lt;- twomonths %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarise(mean=mean(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) meantwomonths ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## Month mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Jan 28.1 ## 2 Jun 15.0 Select the colour and fill based on the variable (which is our month). The intercept is the mean we just calculated, with the lines also based on the coloumn variable. ggplot(twomonths, aes(x=Temp, color=Month, fill=Month)) + geom_histogram(position=&quot;identity&quot;, alpha=0.5)+ geom_vline(data=meantwomonths, aes(xintercept=mean, color=Month), linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;)+ labs(title=&quot;Ggplot2 histogram of Australian Jan and Jun temperatures&quot;, x=&quot;Temperature&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;)+ theme_classic()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) Note how i adjusted the title after i selected the theme, if i had done this before the theme defaults would have overwritten my command. Have you been getting an annoying error message about bin size and non-finate values? Me too!Bin size defaults to 30 in ggplot2 and the non-finate values is referring to lots of NAs (no data) that we have in our dataset. In the code below ive dropped all the NAs with drop_na(), selected a bin width of 5 and produced a faceted plot data_complete_cases &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% drop_na() # Plot faceted histogram ggplot(data_complete_cases, aes(x=Temp, na.rm=TRUE, color=variable))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, binwidth = 5)+ labs(title=&quot;Ggplot2 faceted histogram of Australian temperatures&quot;, x=&quot;Temperature&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;)+ facet_grid(Month ~ .)+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) Does this seem right to you? Wellyes. It shows that the distribution of temperature is higher (or warmer) in the Australian summer (Dec-Feb) than the rest of the year, which makes perfect sense. How about an interactive histogram using plotly See if you can understand what is going on in the code below. Run each line seperately. library(plotly) # split the data for plotly based on month jan &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% filter(., Month==&quot;Jan&quot;) jun &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% drop_na() %&gt;% filter(., Month==&quot;Jun&quot;) # give axis titles x &lt;- list (title = &quot;Temperature&quot;) y &lt;- list (title = &quot;Frequency&quot;) # set the bin width xbinsno&lt;-list(start=0, end=40, size = 2.5) # plot the histogram calling all the variables we just set ihist&lt;-plot_ly(alpha = 0.6) %&gt;% add_histogram(x = jan$Temp, xbins=xbinsno, name=&quot;January&quot;) %&gt;% add_histogram(x = jun$Temp, xbins=xbinsno, name=&quot;June&quot;) %&gt;% layout(barmode = &quot;overlay&quot;, xaxis=x, yaxis=y) ihist This format of code where you set lots of varaibles then call them within a plot, package or fuction is sometihng you should become more familiar with as its considerd good practice. If you were to go on and produce multiple plots using the same legends / aesthetics you only ahve to set them once. Ok so enough with the histogramsthe point is to think about how to best display your data both effectively and efficiently. Lets change the pace a bit and do a quickfire of other descrptive statistics you might want to use # mean per month meanofall &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) # print the top 1 head(meanofall, n=1) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## Month mean ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Apr 22.2 # standard deviation per month sdofall &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(sd = sd(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) # maximum per month maxofall &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(max = max(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) # minimum per month minofall &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(min = min(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) # Interquartlie range per month IQRofall &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(IQR = IQR(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) # perhaps you want to store multiple outputs in one list.. lotsofstats &lt;- squishdata %&gt;% group_by(Month) %&gt;% summarize(IQR = IQR(Temp, na.rm=TRUE), max=max(Temp, na.rm=T)) # or you want to know the mean (or some other stat) #for the whole year as opposed to each month... meanwholeyear=squishdata %&gt;% summarize(meanyear = mean(Temp, na.rm=TRUE)) 3.7 Part 3 interpolation What if you had a selection of points over a spatial area but wanted to generate a complete raster. For this example, we will take our sample points (Australian cities) and estimate data between them using interpolation. If you look at our samples and AUcitytemp data the lat and lon is only in the former. We need to have this with our temperature data so lets combine it using cbind samplestemp&lt;-AUcitytemp%&gt;% cbind(.,samples) Now we need to tell R that our points are spatial points using st_as_sf() from the sf package # convert samples temp to a data frame samplestemp&lt;-samplestemp%&gt;% st_as_sf(.,coords = c(&quot;lon&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs =4326, agr = &quot;constant&quot;) Youll notice that here ive just nicked the CRS from our worldclimtemp. In general its good practice to avoid using static or hard coding references. Rightplot the Australian geometry outline then add our spatial data points ontop plot(Ausoutline$geom) plot(st_geometry(samplestemp), add=TRUE) Lets interpolate using Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW as its more commonly known. IDW is a deterministic method for multivaraite interpolation that estaimtes values for a surface using a weighted average of the provided data. The values closer to the point being predicted have more weight than those further away. The rate at which distance from the provided point imapcts the predcted point is controlled by the power of p. If p=0 then there is no decrease with distance. For more infomation see: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/geostatistical-analyst/how-inverse-distance-weighted-interpolation-works.htm To get a meaningful result we could run some more calucaltions on lets project our data to GDA94 (EPSG:3112) samplestemp &lt;- samplestemp %&gt;% st_transform(., 3112) Ausoutline &lt;- Ausoutline %&gt;% st_transform(., 3112) Here, we need to convert our SF objects to SP, the main reason for doing this is that i will make a grid to store my interpolation and having a remote sensing background i wanted to specify the pixel size. The equivalent function if SF wont let you specify pixel size or there is no easy and straightforward way to do it (at least to my knowledge). samplestempSP &lt;- samplestemp %&gt;% as(., &#39;Spatial&#39;) ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = &quot;PROJ&quot;, multiline = &quot;NO&quot;): Discarded datum Unknown based on GRS80 ellipsoid in CRS definition, ## but +towgs84= values preserved AusoutlineSP &lt;- Ausoutline %&gt;% as(., &#39;Spatial&#39;) ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = &quot;PROJ&quot;, multiline = &quot;NO&quot;): Discarded datum Unknown based on GRS80 ellipsoid in CRS definition, ## but +towgs84= values preserved Next, create an empty grid where cellsize is the spatial resolution, cellsize will overwrite the number of pixels we specified (n). Here as weve used a projected CRS ive put a high cellsize (in metres) so 200km by 200km cells. You can use a smaller number if you wish but it will take much longer to process. emptygrd &lt;- as.data.frame(spsample(AusoutlineSP, n=1000, type=&quot;regular&quot;, cellsize=200000)) names(emptygrd) &lt;- c(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) coordinates(emptygrd) &lt;- c(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) gridded(emptygrd) &lt;- TRUE # Create SpatialPixel object fullgrid(emptygrd) &lt;- TRUE # Create SpatialGrid object # Add the projection to the grid proj4string(emptygrd) &lt;- proj4string(samplestempSP) library(gstat) # Interpolate the grid cells using a power value of 2 interpolate &lt;- gstat::idw(Jan ~ 1, samplestempSP, newdata=emptygrd, idp=2.0) ## [inverse distance weighted interpolation] # Convert output to raster object ras &lt;- raster(interpolate) # Clip the raster to Australia outline rasmask &lt;- mask(ras, Ausoutline) # Plot the raster plot(rasmask) library(gstat) detach(&quot;package:gstat&quot;, unload=TRUE) IDW is just one method for interpolating data, there are many more, if you are interested check out: https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/interpolation-in-r.html 3.8 Auto data download In this practical Ive shown you how to source the data online, download it and load it into R. However for both WorldClim and GADM we can do this straight from R using the getData function.im sorry for making you do it the long way, but its good to do things manually to see how they work. WARNING, this may take some time. Ive changed the resolution to 10 degrees, but Id advise not running this in the practical session. #WorldClim data has a scale factor of 10 when using getData! tmean_auto &lt;- getData(&quot;worldclim&quot;, res=10, var=&quot;tmean&quot;) tmean_auto &lt;- tmean_auto/10 Now for GADM Aus_auto &lt;- getData(&#39;GADM&#39;, country=&quot;AUS&quot;, level=0) Much more convenient right? 3.9 Advanced analysis Are you already comptent with raster analysis and R, then have a go at completing this task in the practical session. Within the practical weve loaded one and created one raster layer. Undertake some comparative analysis to detemrine spatial (and temporal if appropraite) differences between the rasters here and any others you may wish to create (e.g. from other interpolation methods). Try to identify where the varaitions are and explain why they are occuring. You could assume that one raster is the gold standard meaning its beleived to be fully correct and compare others to it.  Or you could go further than this and obtain weather station temperature data (or any other variable) for multiple sites, interpolate based on 50% of the sites and use the remaining sites to assess the accuracy of your selected method / the WorldClim data. Free weather station data can be found here: https://rp5.ru/Weather_in_the_world Have a go and discuss with your fellow students / members of the teaching team during the practical sessions or on slack. 3.10 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form.

Andy Adam OK, this week Im bringing the fire  its my new best mate, Logistics! 4.4 Introduction In this practical you will learn how to produce work that is open, reproducible, shareable and portable using RStudio, RMarkdown, Git and GitHub. As more and more researchers and organisations publish assocaited code with their manusripts or documents its very imporant to become adept at using these tools. The tools you will use are: RStudio is a graphical user interface (that you should already be familiar with)  it contains a number of features which make it excellent for authoring reproducible and open geographic data science work. RMarkdown is a version of the Markdown markup language which enables plain text to be formatted to contain links to data, code to run, text to explain what you a producing and metadata to tell your software what kinds of outputs to generate from your markdown code. For more information on RMarkdown look here. Git is a software version control system which allows you to keep track of the code you produce and the changes that you or others make to it. GitHub is an online repository that allows anyone to view the code you have produced (in whatever language you choose to program in) and use/scrutinise/contribute to/comment on it. 4.5 Git and GitHub 4.5.1 The three ways There are three ways to make your RStudio project work with GitHub Set up the GitHub repository, clone it to your Git then load it in RStudio  using Git GUI Create a new RStudio project and link it to GitHub  new version control If you have an existing RProject then you can link them manually  existing project I will show you all three, you should be able to do way 1, then way 2 using the same repository. Way 3 will have merge issues, so start with a fresh GitHub repository. It is useful if you have produced some code then want to share it at a later date. Follow what i do in the lecture. My advice is to read the Git and GitHub parts of the practical before you start (until the RMarkdown section). 4.5.2 Set up your GitHub If you are working on your own computer, you will first need to install Git  https://git-scm.com/  if you are working on the UCL Remote Desktop, you wont need to do this as it is already installed for you. Go to http://github.com, create an account and create a new repository (call it anything you like - gis_code or something similar), making sure it is public and you check the box that says initialise new repository with a README  click create repository at the bottom Your new repository (repo) will be created and this is where you will be able to store your code online. You will notice that a README.md markdown file has also been created. This can be edited to tell people what they are likely to find in this repository. 4.5.3 Using RStudio with Git Now, as Ive mentioned before, RStudio is totally bad-ass. Not only does it make R fun to use, but the lovely people who created it also built in support for things like git! For a full and excellent tutorial on using Git with R Studio, watch this webinar If you dont want to watch the vid, Ill do a quick summary below. So, to use git, first you need to enable it in RStudio: At the time of writing git integration should work within RStudio. If it doesnt try this again on your laptop. The next part of the practical is going run through the three ways of using Git and GitHub with RStudio as I laid out in The three ways 4.5.4 Using the Git GUI - way 1 Now you have created your repo online, you need to clone it so that there is an identical copy of it in a local folder on your computer. There are a couple of ways of doing this, but the easy one is to use the GUI that comes packaged with your git installation. The first thing you need to do is copy the Clone URL for your repo from the github website  click the green button in your repo for Clone or Download and copy the link: Now in the windows start menu, go to Git &gt; GUI Select Clone Existing Repository and paste the link from your GitHub account into the top box and the local directory that you want to create to store your repo in the bottom box (note, you will need to add a name for a new folder, once you have selected an existing directory, dont create a new folder in windows explorer you have to specify it in the file path). After a few moments, you should now be able to view a copy of your GitHub repo on your local machine. This is where you will be able to store all of your code and some other files for your reproducible research. Open RStudio and go File &gt; New Project &gt; Existing Directory Set the project working directory to what you specified in the Git GUI target directory. You have now linked your project to your local Git Note for later, when we try to push to GitHub from RStudio the push button might be geyed out..this is most likely due to your local Git branch not tracking (following) the GitHub branch! Ishow you how to fix this in the greyed out push button section. 4.5.5 Create a new version control in RStudio - way 2 There is an easier way to set up Git and GitHub with your project, but this assumes you are starting fresh (with no code in an RProject)! Under Set up your GitHub we made a respository on GitHub. Copy that URL. Open RStudio &gt; File New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git Copy in the repository URL and provide a project directory namebut it should populate when you paste in the URL 4.5.6 If have have an existing project - way 3 Start with a fesh GitHub repository, were assuming here that you have some code and then want to share it. DO NOT SELECT a README.md fileit should be an empty GitHub repo Open RStudio and your exsiting project (or make a new onei will make one here). In RStudio Tools &gt; Global Options, under Git/SVN check the box to allow version control and locate the folder on your computer where the git.exe file is located  if you have installed git then this should be automatically there. If you make a new project make sure you create a file (.R or .Rmd through File &gt; New File), add something to it, then save it (File &gt; Save As) into your project folder. When it saves it should apprear in the bottom right Files window. Next go Tools &gt; Project Options &gt; Git/SVN &gt; and select the version control system as Git. You should now see a git tab in the environment window of RStudio (top right) and the files also appear under the Git tab. It should look something like this. Now you will be able to use Git and GitHub as per the following instructionsyou can also refer to practical 8 GitHub last to avoid using the shell (as i did in the lecture) and just use RStudio GUI. 4.5.7 Commiting to Git As well as saving (as you normally do with any file), which saves a copy to our local directory, we will also commit or create a save point for our work on git. To do this, you should click the Git icon and up will pop a menu like the one below: You can also click the Git tab that will have appeared in the top-right window of RStudio. Up will then pop another window that looks a little like the one below: Stage the changes, add a commit message so you can monitor the changes you make, then click commit Make some more changes to your file and save it. Click commit again then in the review changes box you will be able to see what has changed within your file. Add a comitt message and click commit: 4.5.8 Using Git outside RStudio Sometimes RStudio Git can be a bit temperamental. For example, when staging the files they can take some time to appear with the ticked box (I think this is because we are working from the Network). Normally in RStudio you click the commit button, select to stage all the files, wait a few seconds then close the review changes box and commit from the buttons in the Git tab in the environment quadrant. Alternatively if you would like to use Git but youre working on the UCL Remote Desktop or you are experiening other problems with getting git working in RStudio, fear not, you can just use your raw Git installation. In the Start Menu, open the git GUI. Start &gt; Git &gt; Git GUI. You should open the existing repository that you have just created. Whenever you have made some changes to your files in your cloned repo, you can use git to review the changes and Commit (save) them and then Push them up to your master repository on GitHub. To review and commit your changes, in the commit menu, simply: scan for changes stage them ready for committing commit the changes push the changes to your GitHub repo 4.5.9 Push to Github Now we can push our changes to GitHub using the up arrow either in the RStudio Git tab (envrionment quadrant), or from the review changes box (opens when you click commit). To do this, first make sure you have committed any changes to your local cloned repo and then click the Push button to whizz your code up to your master GitHub repo  you might be prompted to enter your github username and password to enable this But.if the push button is greyed out go to the section Greyed out push button 4.5.10 Pull from GitHub Pull will take any changes to the global repo and bring them into your local repo. Go to your example GitHub repo (online) and click on your test file &gt; edit this file. Add a line of code or a comment, preview the changes then commit directly to the master branch. Now in RStudio click the down arrow (Pull) request. Your file should update in RStudio. If you were to update your file on GitHub and your local one in RStudio seperately you would receive an error message in RStudio when you attempted to commit. 4.5.11 Troubleshooting 4.5.11.1 Were you challenged for your password? As of January 2019 it is possible that Git will use a credential helper provided by the operating system. So you should be asked for your GitHub username and password only once. As I am already logged into mine and I started using GitHub a while ago im not exactly sure when you will be asked for you details. You can however set your usename and email manually using the git prompt. Go Tools &gt; Shell and enter: git config --global user.name &#39;yourGitHubUsername&#39; git config --global user.email &#39;name@provider.com&#39; These only need to be set once. 4.5.11.2 Greyed out push button Is your push button greyed out? Mine was when i tried to set it up within an existing project in the section [If have have an existing project]  Fear not. First, lets check your local repostiority (Git) is connected to a remote one (GitHub). Open the Shell again (Tools &gt; Shell) and enter: git remote -v ## output origin https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/example.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/example.git (push) The fetch and push should be your repository on GitHub. If you need to set the remote repo use: git remote add origin https://github.com/andrewmaclachlanc/myrepo.git Replace my name and myrepo with your account and repo  its the same URL that we cloned from GitHub Was it setup correctly ? Yes Then check the current branch in RStudio (and Git) is tracking a branch on the remote repo  mine wasnt. git branch -vv ## output master 3abe929 [origin/master] test3 Origin/master shows that the local master is tracking the origin/master on the remote repo. If you cant see origin/master then set it using: git push --set-upstream origin master Origin is the repository you cloned (from GitHub) and master is the name of the branch. You might see something likeyour branch is ahead of origin/master by 1 commit. This means you have commited something you are working on in you local repo (Git) that hasnt yet been pushed to GitHub (the origin) and master branchGitHub defaults the first branch to be called master. If you need to change the URL of your GitHub . so where you push your local Git to the GitHub account (changing this), perhaps you have made a new GitHub repo git remote set-url origin [enter your cloned URL from GitHUB here]``` For more trouble shooting on Git and GitHub have a look at the book Happy Git and GitHub for the useR 4.5.11.3 reprex If you recall from the introduction to R practical weve already talked a bit about a minimal working (or not working) example (MWE). However, now we know a more about R, Git and GitHub there is a way to easily create a reproducible example (repex) that other people can copy and help you to troubleshoot! Firstly install and load the package install.packages(&quot;reprex&quot;) library(reprex) Then simply copy some code to the clipboard (just control+c or cmd+c if you have a Mac)try copying this to your clipboard A &lt;- 1 B &lt;- 2 C &lt;- A+B C ## [1] 3 The all you do is run reprex() The rendered code will be copied on to your clipboard so you can paste it to wherever needed, perhaps a GitHub issues tab, like the one for this practical book. If you wanted to pass it to stackoverflow or slack then you just need to change the venue argument (default is for GitHub) #stackoverflow reprex(venue=&quot;so&quot;) #slack reprex(venue=&quot;r&quot;) 4.5.12 Fork a repository A Fork in GitHub is a copy of someone elses repository. You could use it as a base starting point for your project or to make a fix and then submit a pull request to the original owner who would then pull your changes to their repository. You can fork a GitHub example repository from: https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife Once you fork it, you should see it in your repositories 4.5.13 Branches Each repository you make in git has a default branch but you can create new branches to isolate development of specific areas of work without affecting other branches  like a test envrionment. Go to the test repository you just forked on github. Click the branch drop down and type in the name for a new branch: Now click on the README.md file &gt; edit this file Add some changes, preview them and complete the commit changes box at the bottom of the screen. Here, were going to commit directly to the new branch. We could have made these changes to the master branch and then made a new branch for them at this stage. Commit the changes. Go to the home page of our example branch (click the branch down arrow and select your example branch). Youll see that our example branch is now 1 commit ahead of the master. Now lets create a pull reqest to the master branch. If you had modified someone elses code, then you would send a reqest to them to pull in the changes. Here we are doing a pull request for ourselves  from our example branch to our master. Click New pull request. At the top you will see the branches that are being compared  the base defaults to githubs example repository, change it to yours. Now scroll down and you will see the comaparison of between the two branches. Click create pull request. Select squash and merge &gt; confirm squash and merge. This means that all our commits on the exmaple branch and squashed into one, as we only have one it doesnt matter but could be useful in future. Go back to your master branch repositry and you should see the changes from the example branch have been merged. We will show you how to publish RMarkdown documents online in a later practical. 4.5.14 Back in time 4.5.14.1 Git Here, were going to use code seen in the section of existing project (way 3). To quick recap here, i have an RProject with some files in, one of which is the test_file.R seen in the in the section of existing project (way 3). We also added some code to this file in the section pulling from GitHub. Now, we are going to add some more code then go back in time to remove it. Ive added z&lt;-5+5 to my script and you can see the file has come up in the Git tab (also called the Git working directory) on the right hand side. Now, as we have done before, Commit(in the Git tab) then the review changes window comes up. Add a commit message, click stage and the Commit. ** Dont push to GitHub yet** But wait, youve just recevied an urgent email (probably using the high importance flag) that the variable z should be deleted, renamed t and be equal to 2. Now, of course, we could just rename it here manually and Commit our changes. But what if you have a large project (like this book!) and make mistakes on several scripts or RMarkdown documents and you need to undo them (like the undo button in Microsoft software). Here we are going to show that. To do this we need to clearly know what we are trying to acheive, for us its easy, go back one commit. We have to use the shell again, click the cog icon then shell.. Now, there are two commands we can use here git reset --soft HEAD~1 or git reset --soft HEAD~1. These simply tell Git to reset to Head-1 commit (your current commit is the Head). Changing the number will alter how many commits you go back. Hard will delete all the changes in the previous commit, soft will move the changes we committed to the Git tab, reversing out commit  always use soft! Type the command git reset --soft HEAD~1, the press enter Youll see that the test_file.R has moved back to the Git tab. Now if you have forgotten what changes you actually made in the last commit, click the Diff icon (next to Commit) and it will show the changes made to each file. 4.5.14.2 GitHub This section follows on from what weve just been through, however, now will we look at how to go back in time once you have pushed to GitHub So change z to t and assign it a value of 2+1. Stage the file, commit to git then now push to GitHub. Think of this as case (a) But waityou missed off an extra 1, t should be 2+1+1. Add the extra 1 commit to git then now push to GitHub. Think of this as case (b) But wait (again!)more incoming news from managementt is wrong, is should be assigned to only 2+1,.but do they not know weve already pushed to GitHub several times!! If we use reset once weve pushed to GitHub it will rewrite the commit history and wont match with GitHub, so if you tried to push to GitHub you will get an error saying the tip of your local branch is behind the remote. This is because you have done back in time locally. It will ask you to pull the changes from the remote. If you have reset, made changes, tried to push, got an error, tried to pull  you will likely get a merge conflict message that you have to correct manually. However, we can instead use revert to maintain the history and avoid any conflicts  revert adds a new commit at then end of the chain of commits. In our case (b) is the curret head, it will add a new commit that is our origial (a) to the end of the chain. On the other hand reset will move your local master (or other branch) back in the chain of commits, but if you moved your local git back whilst your remote (GitHub) remains further along the chain this will cause an error and merge conflicts! To use git revert you have two options either just: git revert HEAD or git revert [input commit ID]. Every commit you make will have an ID (called an SHA). To see the SHA just go to Diff (in the Git tab) &gt; History (top left of the review changes window)  note down your SHA and use it in the shell command. Ok, so to use revert go to the shell and enter git revert HEAD You will probably be met with the VIM (or viewport) window. The best course of action is to input :q to quit and accept the default commit message. You will see already that my test_file.R has already been placed back in the Git tab and t&lt;-2+1 again. If you really want to change the commit message then you need to get into insert mode by typing i &gt; modify text &gt; exit the insert mode with Ctrl+C then &gt; :q to quit. Thanks to the article by Melanie Frazier for this information. If you are storing your R project in a folder that is synchronises online (e.g. OneDrive) you might have issues with this. When you use revert git locks a file which mean it cant synchronise, if you try and do another revert git will not know who you are. It looks like the process of reverting still happens, but just be careful! 4.5.14.3 Git commands If youd rather use shell to control Git then you can. If you have a large project RStudio sometimes has limits on filename length (e.g. this might occur with a book, like this one). To get around this you can use the following commands: git add . to stage all files git commit -m \"commit comment\" to commit all the staged files git push to push the commited files to the remote 4.5.15 Health warning To avoid merge conflicts be careful with your commits, pushes and pulls. Think about what you are doing each time. GitHub help pages are quite comprehensive https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github 4.6 RMarkdown OK, so now you have set everything up so that you can become a reproducible research ninja! All that remains is to do some reproducible research! For the definitive guide on R Markdown, please read R Markdown: The Definitive Guide  obviously! It will tell you everything you need to know, far beyond what I am telling you here. The RMarkdown for scientists workshop by Nicholas Tierney is a really quick guide for how to use it for reproducible science. There is also an excellent guide on the R Studio website And a quick cheatsheet here And an older one here This video is also pretty good at explaining the benefits of RMarkdown R Markdown is awesome as you can show code, explanations and results within the same document!!!! Often it could be very hard to reproduce results owing to a lack of information in the methodology / userguides or walkthrougts not matching up with the latest version of software. Think back to a time where you had to use software and consult a massive userguide in how to use itfor me it was a very painful experience. R Markdown is a big improvement as it puts all of the information in the same document, which can then be convereted into a range of different formats  html for webpages, word documents, PDFs, blogs, books  virtually everything! Its also not limited to R code!!! To change the code language all you have to do is edit what is between the {} in a code chunk (we cover in point 36). In R by default you get {r}, put for python you just change this to {python}!!! COOL. Youve also got to have all the python software installed and the R reticulate() package too.. have a look here for more information. Now, earlier on in this exercise, I got you to open a new R Script. You now need to open a new R Markdown document, you could also select an R NotebookThey are both RMarkdown documents, the notebook originally let you run code chunks that could be exectued independently, however you can also now do this if you select a markdown file. To my knowledge the only difference is that a R Notebook adds output: html_notebook in the output option in the header of the file that adds a Preview button in the tool bar. If you dont have this then the preview option will be replaced with Knit. But you can mix the output options in your header for the file to get the Preview button back if you wish to. Basically, there isnt much difference and you can manually change it with one line of code. Have a look at this stackoverflow question for more infomation. For ease id just stick with R Markdown files There are two ways to create an RMarkdown document File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown You can change the type in the bottom right corner of the script window. I always use way no.1 (so use that here) and this will be populated with some example data, click Knit to see what it doesthe file should load in the viewer pane, if you click the arrow and browser button it will open in an internet browser.. 4.6.1 HTML We are now going to insert some code from the practical last week into the new R Markdown document that ive tweaked a bit and run itclear all of the code except the stuff between the  In RStudio, you can either select Code &gt; Insert Chunk or you can Click the Insert button and insert an R chunk A box will appear and in this box, you will be able to enter and run your R code. Try pasting in: library(plotly) library(raster) library(weathermetrics) GB_auto &lt;- raster::getData(&#39;GADM&#39;, country=&quot;GBR&quot;, level=0, #set the path to store your data in path=&#39;prac4_data/&#39;, download=TRUE) GBclim &lt;- raster::getData(&quot;worldclim&quot;, res=5, var=&quot;tmean&quot;, #set the path to store your data in path=&#39;prac4_data/&#39;, download=TRUE) month &lt;- c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;, &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;) names(GBclim) &lt;- month GBtemp &lt;- GBclim %&gt;% crop(., GB_auto)%&gt;% #WorldClim data has a scale factor of 10! mask(., GB_auto)/10 alldf &lt;- GBtemp %&gt;% as.data.frame()%&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = 1:12, names_to = &quot;Month&quot;, values_to = &quot;Temp&quot;)%&gt;% drop_na() jan&lt;-filter(alldf, Month==&quot;Jan&quot;) jun&lt;-filter(alldf, Month==&quot;Jun&quot;) # give axis titles x &lt;- list (title = &quot;Temperature&quot;) y &lt;- list (title = &quot;Frequency&quot;) # set the bin width xbinsno&lt;-list(start=-5, end=20, size = 2.5) # plot the histogram calling all the variables we just set ihist&lt;-plot_ly(alpha = 0.6) %&gt;% add_histogram(x = jan$Temp, xbins=xbinsno, name=&quot;January&quot;) %&gt;% add_histogram(x = jun$Temp, xbins=xbinsno, name=&quot;June&quot;) %&gt;% layout(barmode = &quot;overlay&quot;, xaxis=x, yaxis=y) ihist When including code chunks in your work, there are various options that allow you to do things like include the code, but not run it: display the output but not the code, hide warnings etc. Most of these can be input automatically by clicking the cog icon in the top-right of the chunk, or you can specify them in the code header of the chunkif you toggle the buttons youll see the code change in the chunk header. There are also two useful icons to the right of the settings cog, the first will run all code above the current chunck (play symbol facing downwards) and the second will run the current code chunk (regular play symbol) 4.6.2 Flexdashboard We can also change what we knit tohow about a dashboard  this could be something like a group of related data plots or visualisations with some code and or descriptions. First you need to install the flexdashboard package and load it install.packages(&quot;flexdashboard&quot;) library(flexdashboard) To do so you change the YAML to --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: flexdashboard::flex_dashboard: runtime: flexdashboard --- Then to add coloumns for the different visualisations add the following not in a code chunk. Here we are going to have a coloumn on the left with our histogram then a coloumn on the right with 2 data plot areas which will be empty for this demonstration This is an example of an interactive dashboard... Column {data-width=600} ------------------------------------- ### Chart 1 Then should be your code chunk from above with the histogram stuff in Underneath the code chunk add (again not in a code chunk) Column {data-width=400} ------------------------------------- ### Chart 2 The add any code you wish (in a chunk), then to place another area beneath (still in the right hand coloumn) just add ### Chart 3 beneath the codewith all code removed it should look like this Note that by default flexdashboard doesnt show codeto show it you need to add echo=TRUE into the R code chunk headers or set global code chunk options (within the first code chunk) through: knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE) 4.6.3 Word document How about a word document? Just change the YAML to --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: word_document --- Ive also removed all the coloumn stuff from the flexdashboardshould look something like this 4.6.4 Knit options Various other options and tips can be found in the full R Markdown guide on RStudio here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html (for code chunk options) 4.6.5 Shortcuts This Twitter thread started by We are R-Ladies is one of the best resources ive found for shortcuts using RMarkdown. Favourties that will help you are: New code chunk CTRL + ALT + i New comment in code CTRL + SHIFT + c Align code consistently CTRL+i Fromant ugly code to nice looking code CTRL + ALT + A Insert section label which is foldable and navigable  this only works in a .R file not a .Rmd but is still useful CTRL + SHIFT + R 4.6.6 Adding references This practical will focus on Mendeley, but there are guides online if you use other reference managers. 4.6.6.1 Set up Mendeley You need to download Mendeley (its free) to produce a BibTeX file. Open Mendeley (from the desktop icon) and populate it with some research papers..you should just be able to download a few .pdfs and drag them into Mendeley. Make sure the metadata (or document details) are correct by clicking this button And editing the fields on the rightNow Go Tools &gt; Options &gt; BibTex Select Escape LaTex special characters, enable BibTex syncing and Create a BibTex file for your whole library or per group. Select to save the BibTeX file in the same folder as your R project, otherwise R wont be able to find it Else you can just use my BibTex file from my GitHub its the .bib. Warning Whilst weve excluded the special characters if they happen to be in some of the fields within Mendeley (e.g. abstracts) this will throw an error This method will auto sync your references to the BibTex file, which you can then load in R. If you use Zotero then follow Adams guide in section 4.1 here 4.6.6.2 Add refereces into R In your document add the following to the YAML header (this is what we call the top of any RMarkdown header, enclosed by ). I beleive it stands for Yet Another Markup Language. Ive added a few extra bitsthese are pretty self-explanatory (e.g table of contents, numbered sections) but have a play around. --- title: &quot;R Notebook&quot; output: html_document: number_sections: yes theme: yeti highlight: textmate toc: yes toc_float: collapsed: no smooth_scroll: yes editor_options: chunk_output_type: inline bibliography: library.bib --- Now to cite someone just use: [@MicheleAcuto2016; @McPherson2016] Note that the name ive used (e.g. McPherson2016) is what Mendeley provided as the citation key for me (see the details about every document you store to find it). The complete bibliography will be placed in the last section, to add a new section to the markdown document just use # and then a space (e.g. # Last section). 4.6.6.3 References using citr If you dont want to type the code above you can also add references to R using citr package library(citr) In the Addins menu near the top of RStudio, you should (once RStudio has been restarted) have a citr option for Insert citations and including them in your work. 4.6.6.4 YAML options Information to help format your knitted file is contained in the YAML header at the top. In here, you can add things like tables of contents, apply specific themes, etc. For a selection of nice themes, see go here For things like adding Tables of Contents, tabbed sections (in HTML), figure and table parameters look here 4.6.6.5 Packrat Packrat is useful as it lets you store all of your loaded packages in a folder within your project, if you were then to move or share your project someone else could load the packages you have used (and the appopraite version) permitting them to run your code with no isses and no inflence their main R package library. You can access Packrat through the icon under the Packages tabor Tools &gt; Project Options.. This practical book is build using RStudio, but as i update the packages and content every year i havent used Packrat here. So go and check out the documentation for more information. 4.7 Binder Binder is a free platform that makes it possible to share code very easily. It lets you take your RProject (that is stored on GitHub) and add a bit of extra code to it that will provide a link button (called a bage), if clicked it will the user to an online workspace with all your code and data loaded, meaning someone could run your analysis with one click anywhere on any device. COOL! Here is the binder badge for the example R project i used to demonstrate Git and GitHub within this practical. This was really easy to make and if you have pushed your R project to GitHub then you are almost there! First you need to install the holepunch package by Karthik Ram. This isnt on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which is central distribution system for R packages whereby each package is reviewed  these packages can just be installed with install.packages(). So instead will can install it from GitHub, be we do need the remotes package  so install that if you dont have it. library(remotes) remotes::install_github(&quot;karthik/holepunch&quot;) Next, we have four simple steps Write a compendium  a standard and recognisable way of organising files Write a docker file  contains commands to create an image of the GitHub repository Create a bage, like mine above and copy the code to a file (e.g. the README.md or a .Rmd). Note, you dont nee to have this in a code chunk. Push to GitHub, then click the bagde! So lets do it! Change the Your compendium name or anything with Your with what you want to call it, write_compendium_description(package = &quot;Your compendium name&quot;, description = &quot;Your compendium description&quot;) write_dockerfile(maintainer = &quot;your_name&quot;) generate_badge() # copy and paste the code generate_badge produces #into the file (e.g. README.md / a .Rmd) of your choice. Commit, then push to GitHub. Be careful! Binder is free but if you have a large project then it might take a while to create (as it gives you between 1 and 2GB of RAM) or time out. For example, I tried to create a binder for this book, it did run eventually but took several hours. The binder will also be deleted after around 10 minutes. That said, its really great for instantly demonstrating your code to your audience. For more information on this, see Karthiks great holepunch package user guide, which is where i got this code from. 4.8 Further reading Since starting this little guide, I have come across the book Happy Git and GitHub for the useR on, well, using R and GitHub by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester. Its brilliant  get involved! Also the GitHub guide 4.9 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form.

Reading This week: Chapter 8 Making maps with R from Geocomputation with R by Lovelace, Nowosad and Muenchow (2020) Remember this is just a starting point, explore the reading list, practical and lecture for more ideas. 5.3 Recommended listening  Some of these practicals are long, take regular breaks and have a listen to some of our fav tunes each week. Andy 5.4 Introduction In this practical were going to focus on creating mapped outputs using QGIS, ArcMap and R. For fun were going to use data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Airbnb. 5.4.1 OSM OpenStreetMap is collaborative project that has created a free editable map of the World. As users can create their own content it is classed as Volunteered geographic Information (VGI). There is a lot of academic literature on VGI, its advnatages and disadvantages. For an overview of VGI checkout this article by Goodchild (2007). If you are interested in exploring the power of VGI and OSM further checkout missing maps. They aim to map missing places, often in less developed countires, using OSM so that when natural disasters occur first responders can make data informed decisions. They run events all over the world and its worth going to meet other spatial professionals, gain some experience with OSM and contribute to a good cause. 5.4.2 Airbnb Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people looking to rent homes to those seeking accomodation often over short time periods. 5.5 Data Its possible to download OSM data straight from the website, although the interface can be a little unreliable (it works better for small areas). There are, however, a number of websites that allow OSM data to be downloaded more easily and are directly linked to from the Export option in OSM. Geofabrik (one of these websites) allows you to download frequently updated shapefiles for various global subdivisions. 5.5.1 OSM Go to the Geofabrik download server website Navigate to: Europe &gt; GreatBritain &gt; England &gt; Greater London Download greater-london-latest-free.shp.zip Unzip the data and save it to your current folder 5.5.2 London boroughs Well use our London boroughs layer again, either load it from week 1 or download it: To get the data go to the London data store Search for Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London Download the statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip Unzip the data and save it to your current folder 5.5.3 World cities We will use World cities to provide some context to our maps. Download them from the ArcGIS HUB &gt; Download &gt; Shapefile. 5.6 QGIS Ok, now were going to reproduce our map in QIGS. As ive given most of the reasoning behind all the tools in the previous ArcMap section this will be more quickfire 5.6.1 Load data Load QGIS, Open and Save a new project (Project &gt; New) Right click on GeoPackage and create a new database to store our data in .gpkg Load our data layers: London boroughs and OSM data (OSM data should be the gis_osm_pois_a_free_1 polygon layer). Make sure the processing toolbox is activego Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins &gt; Installed (left side of the box that opens), Processing should be ticked.then select the cog that is in the toolbar  within the sqaure box in the image below. You can then search for tools in the Processing Toolbox that appears on the right of QGIS. 5.6.2 Manipulate data If you recall from practical 1, QGIS sets the map document CRS to that of the first layer loaded. Our London boroughs layer is in British National Grid (EPSG: 27700) where as are OSM layers are in WGS 1984 (EPSG: 4326). The OSM data will load and QGIS is pretty clever here as it will project on the fly which means it can display the data stored in one projection as if it were in another, but the actual data is not altered. This is both good and bad. Good as it lets us visualise our data quickly, but bad because if we have data with different projections you will run into problems during processing. My advice is to load the data and pick a projection to do all processing in. Reproject the OSM data. If you scroll right in the dialogue box youll be able to save it into your GeoPackage. You might need to refresh the browers to see the layer. While we are working with projectionscheck the CRS of your map (bottom right)mine is EPSG 4326 (WGS 1984) and we want it to be in British National Grid (which is ESPG: 27700), click on it, change it and apply. For completness also drag and drop your London boroughs .shp from the Layers window (bottom left) into your GeoPacakge. Remove the old one from the Layers window. Double click on the new London boroughs layer in the GeoPackage and it will open To get only the hotels out of our OSM data we can use extract by attrbituethis is my tool dialogue box. You can find extract by attribute by clicking the toolbox cog, then searching for extract by attribute. Refresh the browser you have to do this everytime. Double click the layer to load it. Now extract by location using the file you just created and the London boroughs (so hotels within the London boroughs). Note that i selected that the hotels are within the Lonon boroughs Lets now count our hotels per London borough using Join Attributes by Location (Summary). Note i selected the osm_id field to summarise using count in summaries to calcualte. Next up is the Air b n b data, ill show you how to load it then you need to produce a count of rentals per London borough using the same rules as before (entire place/apartment and available all year). To load the data click Data Source Manager &gt; Delimited Text: You need to: Sort the projection out and save into your .gpkg Select by attibute (entire place and 365 days) Select by location (within London boroughs) Join the output to a new (or original) London borough polygon layer Note You can filter by multiple attributes using extract by expressionhere we would use the expression (\"room_type\" ILIKE '%Entire home/apt%') AND (\"availability_365\" ILIKE '%365%') to filter based on entire home/apt and available 365 days of the year. 5.6.3 Map data So now you should have two London borough layers one with a count of all the hotels and the other with a count of all the air b n b propertiesTo make a thematic map right click on the hotel layer &gt; Symbology (tab) select Graduated and your count coloumn as the coloumn, mode as natural breaks and then classify Now save the style so we can use it on our other layer.Style &gt; Save Style &gt; select in Database and provide a name Go to the symbology of the other layer &gt; select Graduated, select the correct count coloumn, then Style &gt; Load Style, from database and your saved style should be listed. To create a new map document in QGIS go: Project &gt; New Print Layout. The layout works by adding a new map which is a snapshop of the main QGIS document. In the main QGIS document only select your airbnb layer, right click and zoom to it. GO back to the Print Layout &gt; Add Item &gt; Add Map..draw a sqaurethe layer should appearIn the window at the bottom right under Item Properties select to Lock layersso now if you were to unselect that layer it would still remain on in the Print Layout Go back to your main QGIS document, now only select the hotels layerrepeat the Add Map steps and lock the layers Make sure you give the same size to both Mapsto do so click on a Map &gt; Item Properties (bottom right) scroll down, expand Position and Size, give the same width and height values Add some guides to line everything up go: View &gt; Manage Guides. The guides panel will appear in the bottom right hand corner, click the + to add a guide at a distance you specify. You can then drag your maps to snap to the guides. Add a scale bar: Add Item &gt; Add Scale Bar. To adjust it, right click &gt; Item Propertiesalter some of the properties to make it look appropraite. Add a legend: Add Item &gt; Add Legend and draw a sqaure. Same process to adjust it. Untick Auto update then you can use the + and - icons to remove items along with the edit icon to change the textthis is what mine looks like Add an arrow: Add Item &gt; Add Arrow, left click to start (twice) and right click to finish. Add text: In the left hand tool bar click add text box and draw a square Lets add our extent map, load the UK .shp, reproject it and save it into your .gpkg. Do the same for your city points but be sure to load them into your .gpkg before you run any tool (just drag and drop them). When reprojecting you might see a lot of errors for certain points in the processing boxdont worry British National Grid only covers the UK  these errors will be for points outside of the UK which we will remove Now replicate our ArcMap inset map by opening the Layer Properties of the new cities layer &gt; Labels &gt; Single Labels with city name, alter any of the text styles as you wish. Also play around with the symbology.. Add the new map into your map layout and move the items to appropraite locations This is what i came up with in my map layout 5.6.4 Export map To export your map to a file go: Layout &gt; Export as Image and select crop to contentand here is my map Note there are a few problems with my map that could be improved: (1) If you look closely at the vector layer for London you will see that one of the boroughs is missing from map (b)  this is most likely because it has no data but could easily be fixed (2) Whilst this time ive displayed all the city names the colour scheme needs workfor ideas on this check out colour brewer. 5.6.5 Graphical modeler As in ArcMap we can automate the methodological process in QGIS using the graphical modeler..again ill provide a short example here Go: Processing &gt; Graphical Modeler Graphical modeler is a bit different to model builder in ArcMap, here you drag inputs and algorthims from the inputs box (bottom left) into the model, you dont need to specify the inputs here. When you click the run buttom (play on the top toolbar) youll be asked to provide the layers for the inputs. The options will be limited to those you currently have open in your mapcheck out the model i made to automate reprojecting cities and the UK outline, then extracting the cities within the UK outline Make sure you save your model from the top tool bar either as a standalone model or within your project 5.7 R Your R and geogprahical are certainly improving by now, so im just going to provide you with the R code i used to do this analysis 5.7.1 Static map ##Load all our data library(sf) library(tmap) library(tmaptools) library(tidyverse) library(here) # read in all the spatial data and # reproject it OSM &lt;- st_read(here::here(&quot;prac5_data&quot;, &quot;greater-london-latest-free.shp&quot;, &quot;gis_osm_pois_a_free_1.shp&quot;)) %&gt;% st_transform(., 27700) %&gt;% #select hotels only filter(fclass == &#39;hotel&#39;) ## Reading layer `gis_osm_pois_a_free_1&#39;

Enjoy! 6.4 Introduction In this practical you will learn how to begin to analyse patterns in spatial data. Using data you are already familiar with, in the first part of the practical, you will explore some techniques for analysing patterns of point data in R. Then, in the second part of the practial, you will explore spatial autocorrelation using R or ArcGISor both if you wish. In this analysis we will analyse the patterns of Blue Plaques  you will see these placed on around the UK linking the buildings of the present to people of the past. The question we want to answer is: For any given London Borough, are the Blue Plaques within that borough distributed randomly or do they exhibit some kind of dispersed or clustered pattern? Before we progress, take a minute to go back and refelct on Grolemund and Wickhams typical workflow of a data science (or GIS) project from workshop 1 To answer this question, we will make use of some of the Point Pattern Analysis functions found in the spatstat package. #first library a few packages that we will use during the practical #note you may need to install them first... library(spatstat) library(here) library(sp) library(rgeos) library(maptools) library(GISTools) library(tmap) library(sf) library(geojson) library(geojsonio) library(tmaptools) 6.5 Setting up your data Now, assuming that youve got a copy of your London Boroughs shapefile (from week 1) in your new week 6 folder, along with a shapefile of your Blue Plaques.

Errant plaques will cause problems with our analysis, so we need to clip the plaques to the boundariesFirst well remove any Plaques with the same grid reference as this will cause problems later on in the analysis.. #remove duplicates library(tidyverse) library(sf) BluePlaques &lt;- distinct(BluePlaques) Now just select the points inside London - thanks to Robin Lovelace for posting how to do this one, very useful!

Therefore to speed things up and to enable us to compare areas within London, we will select some individual boroughs. First we need to subset our SpatialPolygonsDataFrame to pull out a borough we are interested in. Im going to choose Harrow as I know there are few enough points for the analysis to definitely work. If you wish, feel free to choose another borough in London and run the same analysis, but beware that if it happens that there are a lot of blue plaques in your borough, the analysis could fall over!! #extract the borough Harrow &lt;- BoroughMap %&gt;% filter(., NAME==&quot;Harrow&quot;) #Check to see that the correct borough has been pulled out tm_shape(Harrow) + tm_polygons(col = NA, alpha = 0.5) Next we need to clip our Blue Plaques so that we have a subset of just those that fall within the borough or interest #clip the data to our single borough BluePlaquesSub &lt;- BluePlaques[Harrow,] #check that it&#39;s worked tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) ## tmap mode set to interactive viewing tm_shape(Harrow) + tm_polygons(col = NA, alpha = 0.5) + tm_shape(BluePlaquesSub) + tm_dots(col = &quot;blue&quot;) We now have all of our data set up so that we can start the analysis using spatstat. The first thing we need to do is create an observation window for spatstat to carry out its analysis within  well set this to the extent of the Harrow boundary #now set a window as the borough boundary window &lt;- as.owin(Harrow) plot(window) spatstat has its own set of spatial objects that it works with (one of the delights of R is that different packages are written by different people and many have developed their own data types)  it does not work directly with the SpatialPolygonsDataFrames, SpatialPointsDataFrames or sf objects that we are used to. For point pattern analysis, we need to create a point pattern (ppp) object. #create a ppp object BluePlaquesSub&lt;- BluePlaquesSub %&gt;% as(., &#39;Spatial&#39;) BluePlaquesSub.ppp &lt;- ppp(x=BluePlaquesSub@coords[,1], y=BluePlaquesSub@coords[,2], window=window) Try to understand what the different elements in command above is doing. If you are unsure, you can run elements of the code, for example: BluePlaquesSub@coords[,1] ## [1] 516451.0 518560.0 514177.1 515166.2 513053.6 515093.1 515210.7 516746.3 ## [9] 513371.5 514971.1 517339.4 512215.1 515300.0 514966.0 512639.2 515561.8 ## [17] 511539.4 516725.5 512335.7 515370.2 518598.3 511792.6 515694.1 513008.4 ## [25] 514805.8 513392.3 518187.5 513750.4 512466.7 515491.4 514789.8 514022.4 ## [33] 519099.9 514183.4 512343.1 512508.2 512346.3 512269.5 515333.7 Have a look at the new ppp object BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% plot(.,pch=16,cex=0.5, main=&quot;Blue Plaques Harrow&quot;) 6.6 Point pattern analysis 6.6.1 Kernel Density Estimation One way to summarise your point data is to plot the density of your points under a window called a Kernel. The size and shape of the Kernel affects the density pattern produced, but it is very easy to produce a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) map from a ppp object using the density() function. BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% density(., sigma=500) %&gt;% plot() The sigma value sets the diameter of the Kernel (in the units your map is in  in this case, as we are in British National Grid the units are in metres). Try experimenting with different values of sigma to see how that affects the density estimate. BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% density(., sigma=1000) %&gt;% plot() 6.6.2 Quadrat Analysis So as you saw in the lecture, we are interesting in knowing whether the distribution of points in our study area differs from complete spatial randomness  CSR. Thats different from a CRS! Be careful! The most basic test of CSR is a quadrat analysis. We can carry out a simple quadrat analysis on our data using the quadrat count function in spatstat. Note, I wouldnt recommend doing a quadrat analysis in any real piece of analysis you conduct, but it is useful for starting to understand the Poisson distribution #First plot the points plot(BluePlaquesSub.ppp, pch=16, cex=0.5, main=&quot;Blue Plaques in Harrow&quot;) #now count the points in that fall in a 6 x 6 #grid overlaid across the windowBluePlaquesSub.ppp2&lt;-BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% quadratcount(.,nx = 6, ny = 6)%&gt;% plot(., add=T, col=&quot;red&quot;) In our case here, want to know whether or not there is any kind of spatial patterning associated with the Blue Plaques in areas of London. If you recall from the lecture, this means comparing our observed distribution of points with a statistically likely (Complete Spatial Random) distibution, based on the Poisson distribution. Using the same quadratcount() function again (for the same sized grid) we can save the results into a table: #run the quadrat count Qcount &lt;- BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% quadratcount(.,nx = 6, ny = 6) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% dplyr::count(Var1=Freq)%&gt;% dplyr::rename(Freqquadratcount=n) #we don&#39;t need the last row, so remove it QCountTable &lt;- Qcount %&gt;% slice(., -(nrow(Qcount))) Check the data type in the first column  if it is factor, we will need to convert it to numeric QCountTable %&gt;% summarise_all(class) ## Var1 Freqquadratcount ## 1 integer integer OK, so we now have a frequency table  next we need to calculate our expected values. The formula for calculating expected probabilities based on the Poisson distribution is: \\[Pr= (X =k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k}e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\\] sums &lt;- QCountTable %&gt;% #calculate the total blue plaques (Var * Freq) mutate(total = Var1 * Freqquadratcount) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(across(everything(), sum))%&gt;% dplyr::select(-Var1) lambda&lt;- QCountTable%&gt;% #calculate lambda mutate(total = Var1 * Freqquadratcount)%&gt;% dplyr::summarise(across(everything(), sum)) %&gt;% mutate(lambda=total/Freqquadratcount) %&gt;% dplyr::select(lambda)%&gt;% pull(lambda) Calculate expected using the Poisson formula from above \\(k\\) is the number of blue plaques counted in a square and is found in the first column of our table QCountTable &lt;- QCountTable %&gt;% mutate(Pr=((lambda^Var1)*exp(-lambda))/factorial(Var1))%&gt;% #now calculate the expected counts and save them to the table mutate(Expected= (round(Pr * sums$Freqquadratcount, 0))) #Compare the frequency distributions of the observed and expected point patterns plot(c(1,5),c(0,14), type=&quot;n&quot;, xlab=&quot;Number of Blue Plaques (Red=Observed,Blue=Expected)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Frequency of Occurances&quot;) points(QCountTable$Freqquadratcount, col=&quot;Red&quot;, type=&quot;o&quot;, lwd=3) points(QCountTable$Expected, col=&quot;Blue&quot;, type=&quot;o&quot;, lwd=3) Comparing the observed and expected frequencies for our quadrat counts, we can observe that they both have higher frequency counts at the lower end  something reminiscent of a Poisson distribution. This could indicate that for this particular set of quadrats, our pattern is close to Complete Spatial Randomness (i.e. no clustering or dispersal of points). But how do we confirm this? To check for sure, we can use the quadrat.test() function, built into spatstat. This uses a Chi Squared test to compare the observed and expected frequencies for each quadrat (rather than for quadrat bins, as we have just computed above). If the p-value of our Chi-Squared test is &gt; 0.05, then we can reject a null hyphothesis that says there is no complete spatial randomness in our data (think of a null-hypothesis as the opposite of a hypothesis that says our data exhibit complete spatial randomness). What we need to look for is a value for p &gt; 0.05. If our p-value is &gt; 0.05 then this indicates that we have CSR and there is no pattern in our points. If it is &lt; 0.05, this indicates that we do have clustering in our points. teststats &lt;- quadrat.test(BluePlaquesSub.ppp, nx = 6, ny = 6) plot(BluePlaquesSub.ppp,pch=16,cex=0.5, main=&quot;Blue Plaques in Harrow&quot;) plot(teststats, add=T, col = &quot;red&quot;) So we can see that the indications are there is no spatial patterning for Blue Plaques in Harrow  at least for this particular grid. Note the warning message  some of the observed counts are very small (0) and this may affect the accuracy of the quadrat test. Recall that the Poisson distribution only describes observed occurrances that are counted in integers  where our occurances = 0 (i.e. not observed), this can be an issue. We also know that there are various other problems that might affect our quadrat analysis, such as the modifiable areal unit problem. In the new plot, we can see three figures for each quadrat. The top-left figure is the observed count of points; the top-right is the Poisson expected number of points; the bottom value is the residual value (also known as Pearson residual value), or (Observed - Expected) / Sqrt(Expected). This is the first mention of the mathematician Karl Pearson who founded the worlds first university statistics department here at UCL. Pearson was a eugenicist and the Unversitys first Chair of Eugenics that was established on the request of Galton (who coined the term eugenics and Pearson studied under) for the residue of his estate. Throuhgout research you may encounter Pearsons name as it is used to identify certain techniques, for example, Pearsons product-moment coefficient (alternatively just product-moment coefficient). Where possible within this book I have removed references to Pearson, although as you will see later on some arguments in functions still require the value pearson and certain output messages default to include his name. UCL recently denamed spaces and buildings named after Pearson and Galton. 6.6.3 Try experimenting Try running a quadrat analysis for different grid arrangements (2 x 2, 3 x 3, 10 x 10 etc.)  how does this affect your results? 6.6.4 Ripleys K One way of getting around the limitations of quadrat analysis is to compare the observed distribution of points with the Poisson random model for a whole range of different distance radii. This is what Ripleys K function computes. We can conduct a Ripleys K test on our data very simply with the spatstat package using the kest() function. K &lt;- BluePlaquesSub.ppp %&gt;% Kest(., correction=&quot;border&quot;) %&gt;% plot() The plot for K has a number of elements that are worth explaining. First, the Kpois(r) line in Red is the theoretical value of K for each distance window (r) under a Poisson assumption of Complete Spatial Randomness. The Black line is the estimated values of K accounting for the effects of the edge of the study area. Where the value of K falls above the line, the data appear to be clustered at that distance. Where the value of K is below the line, the data are dispersed. From the graph, we can see that up until distances of around 1300 metres, Blue Plaques appear to be clustered in Harrow, however, at around 1500 m, the distribution appears random and then dispersed between about 1600 and 2100 metres. 6.6.5 Alternatives to Ripleys K There are a number of alternative measures of spatial clustering which can be computed in spatstat such as the G and the L functions  I wont go into them now, but if you are interested, you should delve into the following references: Bivand, R. S., Pebesma, E. J., &amp; Gómez-Rubio, V. (2008). Applied spatial data analysis with R. New York: Springer. Brundson, C., Comber, L., (2015) An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis &amp; Mapping. Sage. https://research.csiro.au/software/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/02/Rspatialcourse_CMIS_PDF-Standard.pdf 6.7 Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise: DBSCAN Quadrat and Ripleys K analysis are useful exploratory techniques for telling us if we have spatial clusters present in our point data, but they are not able to tell us WHERE in our area of interest the clusters are occurring. To discover this we need to use alternative techniques. One popular technique for discovering clusters in space (be this physical space or variable space) is DBSCAN. For the complete overview of the DBSCAN algorithm, read the original paper by Ester et al. (1996) or consult the wikipedia page library(raster) library(fpc) We will now carry out a DBSCAN analysis of blue plaques in my borough to see if there are any clusters present. #first check the coordinate reference system of the Harrow spatial polygon: st_geometry(BoroughMap) ## Geometry set for 33 features ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 503568.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561957.5 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid ## First 5 geometries: ## MULTIPOLYGON (((516401.6 160201.8, 516407.3 160... ## MULTIPOLYGON (((535009.2 159504.7, 535005.5 159... ## MULTIPOLYGON (((540373.6 157530.4, 540361.2 157... ## MULTIPOLYGON (((521975.8 178100, 521967.7 17809... ## MULTIPOLYGON (((510253.5 182881.6, 510249.9 182... DBSCAN requires you to input two parameters: 1. Epsilon - this is the radius within which the algorithm with search for clusters 2. MinPts - this is the minimum number of points that should be considered a cluster Based on the results of the Ripleys K analysis earlier, we can see that we are getting clustering up to a radius of around 1200m, with the largest bulge in the graph at around 700m. Therefore, 700m is probably a good place to start and we will begin by searching for clusters of at least 4 points #first extract the points from the spatial points data frame BluePlaquesSubPoints &lt;- BluePlaquesSub %&gt;% coordinates(.)%&gt;% as.data.frame() #now run the dbscan analysis db &lt;- BluePlaquesSubPoints %&gt;% fpc::dbscan(.,eps = 700, MinPts = 4) #now plot the results plot(db, BluePlaquesSubPoints, main = &quot;DBSCAN Output&quot;, frame = F) plot(BoroughMap$geometry, add=T) You could also use kNNdistplot() from the dbscan pacakge to find a suitable eps value based on the knee in the plot # used to find suitable eps value based on the knee in plot # k is no of nearest neighbours used, use min points library(dbscan) BluePlaquesSubPoints%&gt;% dbscan::kNNdistplot(.,k=4) So the DBSCAN analysis shows that for these values of eps and MinPts there are three clusters in the area I am analysing. Try varying eps and MinPts to see what difference it makes to the output. Now of course the plot above is a little basic and doesnt look very aesthetically pleasing. As this is R and R is brilliant, we can always produce a much nicer plot by extracting the useful information from the DBSCAN output and use ggplot2 to produce a much cooler map library(ggplot2) Our new db object contains lots of info including the cluster each set of point coordinates belongs to, whether the point is a seed point or a border point etc. We can get a summary by just calling the object db ## dbscan Pts=39 MinPts=4 eps=700 ## 0 1 2 3 4 ## border 15 1 0 3 4 ## seed 0 6 8 1 1 ## total 15 7 8 4 5 If you open up the object in the environment window in RStudio, you will also see the various slots in the object, including cluster db$cluster ## [1] 0 3 0 1 4 0 1 0 4 1 0 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 2 1 3 0 0 0 0 4 3 4 2 0 0 4 3 0 2 2 2 2 ## [39] 1 We can now add this cluster membership info back into our dataframe BluePlaquesSubPoints&lt;- BluePlaquesSubPoints %&gt;% mutate(dbcluster=db$cluster) Next we are going to create some convex hull polygons to wrap around the points in our clusters. Use the ddply() function in the plyr package to get the convex hull coordinates from the cluster groups in our dataframe chulls &lt;- BluePlaquesSubPoints %&gt;% group_by(dbcluster) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(hull = 1:n(), hull = factor(hull, chull(coords.x1, coords.x2)))%&gt;% arrange(hull) #chulls2 &lt;- ddply(BluePlaquesSubPoints, .(dbcluster), # function(df) df[chull(df$coords.x1, df$coords.x2), ]) As 0 isnt actually a cluster (its all points that arent in a cluster) drop it from the dataframe chulls &lt;- chulls %&gt;% filter(dbcluster &gt;=1) Now create a ggplot2 object from our data dbplot &lt;- ggplot(data=BluePlaquesSubPoints, aes(coords.x1,coords.x2, colour=dbcluster, fill=dbcluster)) #add the points in dbplot &lt;- dbplot + geom_point() #now the convex hulls dbplot &lt;- dbplot + geom_polygon(data = chulls, aes(coords.x1,coords.x2, group=dbcluster), alpha = 0.5) #now plot, setting the coordinates to scale correctly and as a black and white plot #(just for the hell of it)... dbplot + theme_bw() + coord_equal() Now we are getting there, but wouldnt it be better to add a basemap?! ###add a basemap ##First get the bbox in lat long for Harrow HarrowWGSbb &lt;- Harrow %&gt;% st_transform(., 4326)%&gt;% st_bbox() Now convert the basemap to British National Grid library(OpenStreetMap) basemap &lt;- OpenStreetMap::openmap(c(51.5549876,-0.4040502),c(51.6405356,-0.2671315), zoom=NULL, &quot;stamen-toner&quot;) # convert the basemap to British National Grid basemap_bng &lt;- openproj(basemap, projection=&quot;+init=epsg:27700&quot;) Now we can plot our fancy map with the clusters on autoplot(basemap_bng) + geom_point(data=BluePlaquesSubPoints, aes(coords.x1,coords.x2, colour=dbcluster, fill=dbcluster)) + geom_polygon(data = chulls, aes(coords.x1,coords.x2, group=dbcluster, fill=dbcluster), alpha = 0.5) 6.8 Point pattern analysis summary This is end of the point pattern analysis section of the practical. You have been introduced to the basics of Point Pattern Analysis examining the distribution of Blue Plaques in a London Borough. At this point, you may wish to try running similar analyses on different boroughs (or indeed the whole city) and playing with some of the outputs  although you will find that Ripleys K will fall over very quickly if you try to run the analysis on that many points) This how you might make use of these techniques in another context or with different point data 6.9 Analysing Spatial Autocorrelation with Morans I, LISA and friends In this section we are going to explore patterns of spatially referenced continuous observations using various measures of spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation is a measure of similarity between nearby data. Check out the various references in the reading list for more information about the methods we will explore today. There are also useful links in the helpfile of the spdep package which we will be using here. 6.9.1 Data download Before we get any further, lets get some ward boundaries read in to R  download LondonWardData from Github and read it in library(here) #read the ward data in LondonWards &lt;- st_read(here::here(&quot;prac6_data&quot;, &quot;LondonWards.shp&quot;)) ## Reading layer `LondonWards&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\prac6_data\\LondonWards.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 625 features and 77 fields ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 503568.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561957.5 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid Its probably projected correctly, but in case it isnt give it a projection using the CRS() function in the raster package #have a look to check that it&#39;s #in the right projection st_crs(LondonWards) ## Coordinate Reference System: ## User input: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid ## wkt: ## PROJCRS[&quot;OSGB 1936 / British National Grid&quot;, ## BASEGEOGCRS[&quot;OSGB 1936&quot;, ## DATUM[&quot;OSGB 1936&quot;, ## ELLIPSOID[&quot;Airy 1830&quot;,6377563.396,299.3249646, ## LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]]], ## PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0, ## ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,4277]], ## CONVERSION[&quot;British National Grid&quot;, ## METHOD[&quot;Transverse Mercator&quot;, ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,9807]], ## PARAMETER[&quot;Latitude of natural origin&quot;,49, ## ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8801]], ## PARAMETER[&quot;Longitude of natural origin&quot;,-2, ## ANGLEUNIT[&quot;degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8802]], ## PARAMETER[&quot;Scale factor at natural origin&quot;,0.9996012717, ## SCALEUNIT[&quot;unity&quot;,1], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8805]], ## PARAMETER[&quot;False easting&quot;,400000, ## LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8806]], ## PARAMETER[&quot;False northing&quot;,-100000, ## LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,8807]]], ## CS[Cartesian,2], ## AXIS[&quot;(E)&quot;,east, ## ORDER[1], ## LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]], ## AXIS[&quot;(N)&quot;,north, ## ORDER[2], ## LENGTHUNIT[&quot;metre&quot;,1]], ## USAGE[ ## SCOPE[&quot;unknown&quot;], ## AREA[&quot;UK - Britain and UKCS 49Â°46&#39;N to 61Â°01&#39;N, 7Â°33&#39;W to 3Â°33&#39;E&quot;], ## BBOX[49.75,-9.2,61.14,2.88]], ## ID[&quot;EPSG&quot;,27700]] tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) tm_shape(LondonWards) + tm_polygons(col = NA, alpha = 0.5) + tm_shape(BluePlaques) + tm_dots(col = &quot;blue&quot;) 6.9.2 Data cleaning Ah yes, we might need to lose the blue plaques that fall outside of London summary(BluePlaques) ## geometry ## POINT :2711 ## epsg:27700 : 0 ## +proj=tmer...: 0 BluePlaquesSub &lt;- BluePlaques[LondonWards,] tm_shape(LondonWards) + tm_polygons(col = NA, alpha = 0.5) + tm_shape(BluePlaquesSub) + tm_dots(col = &quot;blue&quot;) 6.9.3 Data manipulation The measures of spatial autocorrelation that we will be using require continuous observations (counts of blue plaques, average GCSE scores, average incomes etc.) to be spatially referenced (i.e. attached to a spatial unit like a ward or a borough). The file you have already has the various obervations associated with the London Ward data file already attached to it, but lets continue with our blue plaques example for now. To create a continuous observation from the blue plaques data we need to count all of the blue plaques that fall within each Ward in the City. Luckily, we can do this using the st_join() function from the sf package. library(sf) points_sf_joined &lt;- LondonWards%&gt;% st_join(BluePlaquesSub)%&gt;% add_count(WardName)%&gt;% #calcualte area mutate(area=st_area(.))%&gt;% #then density of the points per ward mutate(density=n/area)%&gt;% #select density and some other variables dplyr::select(density, WardName, Wardcode, n, AvgGCSE201) How about a quick choropleth map to see how we are getting on points_sf_joined&lt;- points_sf_joined %&gt;% group_by(Wardcode) %&gt;% summarise(density = first(density), wardname= first(WardName), plaquecount= first(n)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) tm_shape(points_sf_joined) + tm_polygons(&quot;density&quot;, style=&quot;jenks&quot;, palette=&quot;PuOr&quot;, midpoint=NA, popup.vars=c(&quot;wardname&quot;, &quot;density&quot;), title=&quot;Blue Plaque Density&quot;) So, from the map, it looks as though we might have some clustering of blue plaques in the centre of London so lets check this with Morans I and some other statistics. Before being able to calculate Morans I and any similar statistics, we need to first define a \\(W_{ij}\\) spatial weights matrix library(spdep) First calculate the centroids of all Wards in London #First calculate the centroids of all Wards in London coordsW &lt;- points_sf_joined%&gt;% st_centroid()%&gt;% st_geometry() plot(coordsW,axes=TRUE) Now we need to generate a spatial weights matrix (remember from the lecture). Well start with a simple binary matrix of queens case neighbours (otherwise known as Contiguity edges corners). Thie method means that polygons with a shared edge or a corner will be included in computations for the target polygon #create a neighbours list LWard_nb &lt;- points_sf_joined %&gt;% poly2nb(., queen=T) #plot them plot(LWard_nb, st_geometry(coordsW), col=&quot;red&quot;) #add a map underneath plot(points_sf_joined$geometry, add=T) #create a spatial weights object from these weights Lward.lw &lt;- LWard_nb %&gt;% nb2listw(., style=&quot;C&quot;) head(Lward.lw$neighbours) ## [[1]] ## [1] 6 7 10 462 468 482 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 5 8 9 11 12 13 16 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 10 11 12 15 480 483 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 17 281 291 470 473 481 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 2 9 16 281 283 290 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 1 7 8 10 11 14 6.9.4 Spatial autocorrelation Now we have defined our \\(W_{ij}\\) matrix, we can calculate the Morans I and other associated statistics Morans I test tells us whether we have clustered values (close to 1) or dispersed values (close to -1), we will calculate for the densities rather than raw values I_LWard_Global_Density &lt;- points_sf_joined %&gt;% pull(density) %&gt;% as.vector()%&gt;% moran.test(., Lward.lw) I_LWard_Global_Density ## ## Moran I test under randomisation ## ## data: . ## weights: Lward.lw ## ## Moran I statistic standard deviate = 30.153, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: greater ## sample estimates: ## Moran I statistic Expectation Variance ## 0.6709099428 -0.0016025641 0.0004974485 Gearys C as well..?

This tells us whether high or low values are clustering.

We can now also calculate local versions of the Morans I statistic (for each Ward) and a Getis Ord \\(G_{i}^{*}\\) statistic to see where we have hot-spots #use the localmoran function to generate I for each ward in the city I_LWard_Local_count &lt;- points_sf_joined %&gt;% pull(plaquecount) %&gt;% as.vector()%&gt;% localmoran(., Lward.lw)%&gt;% as_tibble() I_LWard_Local_Density &lt;- points_sf_joined %&gt;% pull(density) %&gt;% as.vector()%&gt;% localmoran(., Lward.lw)%&gt;% as_tibble() #what does the output (the localMoran object) look like? slice_head(I_LWard_Local_Density, n=5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 5 ## Ii E.Ii Var.Ii Z.Ii `Pr(z &gt; 0)` ## &lt;localmrn&gt; &lt;localmrn&gt; &lt;localmrn&gt; &lt;localmrn&gt; &lt;localmrn&gt; ## 1 0.08200123 -0.001632161 0.1583582 0.2101645 0.4167696 ## 2 0.10386087 -0.001904187 0.1844775 0.2462467 0.4027456 ## 3 0.08386536 -0.001632161 0.1583582 0.2148489 0.4149426 ## 4 0.10960321 -0.001632161 0.1583582 0.2795262 0.3899205 ## 5 0.10744247 -0.001632161 0.1583582 0.2740965 0.3920052 There are 5 columns of data.

Hopefully you have learned a lot about the different methods we can employ to analyse patterns in spatial data. This practical was deliberately designed as a walk through, but this may have given you ideas about where you could perhaps take these techniques in your coursework if this is something you wanted to explore further with different data or in different contexts. 6.10 Extension Already a pro with point pattern and spatial autocorrelation analysis? Then try the following out: We have used sp objects in this practical (because I wrote it before sf became the defacto spatial data type in R). Can you convert some of this so it works withsf? Could you atomate any of the functions so that you could quickly produce maps of any of the variables in the LondonWards dataset? Could you get these outputs into a faceted ggplot2 map?

Feel free to follow your own GIS interests, but good places to start include the following: Assignment From weeks 6-9, learn and practice analysis from the course and identify appropriate techniques (from wider research) that might be applicable/relevant to your data. Conduct an extensive methodological review  this could include analysis from within academic literature and/or government departments (or any reputable source). Reading This week: Appendix Raster operations in R from Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis by Gimond (2019) Raster manipulation\" from Spatial data science by Hijmans (2016). This last one is another tutoiral  it seems there arent any decent free raster textbook chapters, let me know if you find one. Remember this is just a starting point, explore the reading list, practical and lecture for more ideas. 7.3 Recommended listening  Some of these practicals are long, take regular breaks and have a listen to some of our fav tunes each week. Andy Adam This week, its DJ Shadow. Yes, you heard correctly! DJ Shadow is back with an epic double-album. Disc 1 is fully instrumental and, some may say, a little less immediate. Disc 2 will be more reminiscent some of his classic collaborations from earlier albums. Its hip hop Jim, but not as we know it. 7.4 Introduction Within this practical we are going to be using data from the Landsat satellite series provided for free by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to replicate published methods. Landsat imagery is the longest free temporal image repository of consistent medium resolution data. It collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution). Geographical analysis and concepts are becoming ever more entwined with remote sensing and Earth observation. Back when I was an undergraduate there was specific software for undertaking certain analysis, now you can basically use any GIS. I see remote sensing as the science behind collecting the data with spatial data analysis then taking that data and providing meaning. So whilst ill give a background to Landsat data and remote sensing, this practical will focus on more advanced methods for analysing and extracting meaning from raster data. 7.5 .gitignore If you are using Git with your project and have large data its best to set up a .gitignore file. This file tells git to ignore certain files so they arent in your local repository that is then pushed to GitHub. If you try and push large files to GitHub you will get an error and could run into lots of problems, trust me, ive been there. Look at my .gitignore for this repository and you will notice: prac7_data/Lsatdata/* prac7_data/exampleGoogleDrivedata/* prac7_data/Manchester_boundary/* This means igore all files within these folders, all is denoted by the *. The .gitignore has to be in your main project folder, if you have made a a git repo for your project then you should have a .gitignore so all you have to do is open it and add the folder or file paths you wish to ignore. GitHub has a maximum file upload size of 50mb.image credit reddit r/ProgrammerHumor 7.5.1 Remote sensing background (required) Landsat is raster data It has pixels of 30 by 30m collected every 16 days with global coverage As humans we see in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (red-green-blue) Landsat takes samples in these bands and several more to make a spectral sigature for each pixel (see image below) Each band is provided as a seperate .TIFF raster layer Later on we will compute temperature from the Landsat data, whilst i refer to and explain each varaiable created dont get overwhelmed by it, take away the process of loading and manipulating raster data in R to extract meaningful information. An optional remote sensing background containing additional information can be found at the end of this practical should you wish to explore this further. 7.6 Data 7.6.1 Shapefile The shapefile of Manchester is available from the data folder for this week on GitHub. To download this consult How to download data and files from GitHub, id used Option 1. 7.6.2 Raster data (Landsat) To access the Landsat data we will use in this practical you can either: Sign up for a free account at: https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. Use the Landsat data provided on Moodle  this will be available only if the earth explorer website is down (e.g. in the case of US government shutdowns) To download the data: Search for Manchester in the address/place box and select it. Select the date range between the 12/5/2019 and 14/5/2019  its a US website so check the dates are correct. Click dataset and select Landsat, then Landsat Collection 1 Level-1, check Landsat 8 (level 2 is surface reflectance  see Remote sensing background (optional) Click results, there should be one image, download it..it might take a while Landsat data comes zipped twice as a .tar.gz. Use 7Zip or another file extractor, extract it once to get to a .tar then extract again and files should appear. Or the code below will also let you extract Landsat data 7.6.2.1 Alternative raster data Occasionally the earth explorer website can go down for maintenance or during government shutdowns. If possible I strongly advise you to learn how to use its interface as multiple other data providers have similar interfaces. GitHub also place a strict size limit on files of 100MB. However, in order to account for situations like this Ive placed the zipped file on GoogleDrive and will demonstrate how to access this from R using the new googledrive package. This could be a great option for you to gain reproducibility points if you have large files that you cant upload to GitHub. In GoogleDrive you need to ensure your file is shareable with others  right click on it &gt; Share &gt; then copy the link. I have done this for my file in the example below, but if you try and replicate this, make sure youve done it otherwise it might not work when other people try and run your code, as they wont have access to the file on your GoogleDrive. Depending on your internet speed this example might take some time Be sure to change the path to your practical 7 folder but make sure you include the filename within it and set overwrite to T (or TRUE) if you are going to run this again. library(&quot;googledrive&quot;) o&lt;-drive_download(&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MV7ym_LW3Pz3MxHrk-qErN1c_nR0NWXy&quot;, path=&quot;prac7_data/exampleGoogleDrivedata/LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1.tar.gz&quot;, overwrite=T) Next we need to uncompress and unzip the file with untar(), first list the files that end in the extension .gz then pass that to untar with the pipe %&gt;% remember this basically means after this function thendo this other function with that data library(tidyverse) library(fs) library(stringr) library(utils) listfiles&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;exampleGoogleDrivedata&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;.gz&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% dplyr::pull()%&gt;% #print out the .gz file print()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% utils::untar(exdir=here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;exampleGoogleDrivedata&quot;)) 7.7 Processing raster data 7.7.1 Loading Today, we are going to be using a Landsat 8 raster of Manchester. The vector shape file for Manchester has been taken from an ESRI repository. Lets load the majority of packages we will need here. ## listing all possible libraries that all presenters may need following each practical library(sp) library(raster) library(rgeos) library(rgdal) library(rasterVis) library(ggplot2) Now lets list all our Landsat bands except band 8 (ill explain why next) along with our study area shapefile. Each band is a seperate .TIF file. library(stringr) library(raster) library(fs) library(sf) library(tidyverse) # List your raster files excluding band 8 using the patter argument listlandsat&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;))%&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;[B123456790].TIF&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% # Load our raster layers into a stack stack() # Load the manchester boundary manchester_boundary &lt;- st_read(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Manchester_boundary&quot;, &quot;Manchester_boundary.shp&quot;)) ## Reading layer `Manchester_boundary&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\prac7_data\\Manchester_boundary\\Manchester_boundary.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 5 fields ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 540926.6 ymin: 5917117 xmax: 558663.4 ymax: 5933117 ## projected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 30N #check they have the same Coordinate Reference System (CRS) crs(manchester_boundary) ## CRS arguments: ## +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs crs(listlandsat) ## CRS arguments: ## +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 7.7.2 Resampling There is an error with this dataset as band 8 does not fully align with the extent of the other raster layers. There are several ways to fix this, but in this tutorial we will resample the band 8 layer with the extent of band 1. First, read in the band 8 and store it as a raster. # get band 8 b8list&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;))%&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;[B8].tif&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% raster() Then, resample() and write out the new layer, resampling takes awhile, so please be patient or find my output on GitHub. ## ngb is a nearest neighbour sampling method b8correct &lt;- b8list%&gt;% resample(., listlandsat$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B1, method = &quot;ngb&quot;) %&gt;% # Write out the raster writeRaster(.,str_c(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;), names(b8list), sep=&quot;/&quot;), format=&#39;GTiff&#39;, overwrite=TRUE) Load band 8 and add it to our raster stack b8backin&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;))%&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;[B8].tif&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% raster() listlandsat &lt;- listlandsat %&gt;% addLayer(., b8backin) We can compare it to see if both rasters have the same extent, number of rows and columns, projection, resolution and origin raster::compareRaster(listlandsat$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B1, listlandsat$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B8) ## [1] TRUE 7.7.3 Clipping Our raster is currently the size of the scene which satellite data is distributed in, to clip it to our study area its best to first crop it to the extent of the shapefile and then mask it as we have done in previous practicals lsatmask &lt;- listlandsat %&gt;% # now crop our temp data to the extent crop(.,manchester_boundary)%&gt;% mask(., manchester_boundary) If all we wanted to do was clip our data, we could now change our filenames in the raster stack and write the .TIFF files out again # add mask to the filenames within the raster stack names(lsatmask) &lt;- names(lsatmask)%&gt;% str_c(., &quot;mask&quot;, sep=&quot;_&quot;) # I need to write mine out in another location outputfilenames &lt;- str_c(&quot;prac7_data/Lsatdata/&quot;, &quot;mask/&quot;, names(lsatmask) ,sep=&quot;&quot;) In the first line of code im taking the original names of the raster layers and adding mask to the end of them. This is done using str_c() from the stringr package and the arguments names(lsatmask): original raster layer names \"mask\": what i want to add to the names sep=\"\": how the names and mask should be seperated  \"\" means no spaces As i cant upload my Landsat files to GitHub im storing them in a folder that is not linked (remember this is all sotred on GitHub)  so you wont find prac7_data/Lsatdata on there. If you want to store your clipped Landsat files in your project directory just use: lsatmask %&gt;% writeRaster(., names(lsatmask), bylayer=TRUE, format=&#39;GTiff&#39;, overwrite=TRUE) For me though its: lsatmask %&gt;% writeRaster(., outputfilenames, bylayer=TRUE, format=&#39;GTiff&#39;, overwrite=TRUE) Here i write out each raster layer individually though specifying bylayer=TRUE. 7.8 Data exploration 7.8.1 More loading and manipulating For the next stage of analysis we are only interested in bands 1-7, we can either load them back in from the files we just saved or take them directly from the original raster stack. # either read them back in from the saved file: manc_files&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;, &quot;mask&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;[B1234567]_mask.tif&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;B11&quot;, negate=TRUE))%&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% stack() # or extract them from the original stack manc&lt;-stack(lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B1_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B2_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B3_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B4_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B5_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B6_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B7_mask) # Name the Bands based on where they sample the electromagentic spectrum names(manc) &lt;- c(&#39;ultra-blue&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;NIR&#39;, &#39;SWIR1&#39;, &#39;SWIR2&#39;) If you want to extract specific information from a raster stack use: crs(manc) # projection extent(manc) # extent ncell(manc) # number of cells dim(manc) # number of rows, columns, layers nlayers(manc) # number of layers res(manc) # xres, yres 7.8.2 Plotting data Lets actually have a look at our raster data, first in true colour (how humans see the world) and then false colour composites (using any other bands but not the combination of red, green and blue). # true colour composite manc_rgb &lt;- stack(manc$red, manc$green, manc$blue) # false colour composite manc_false &lt;- stack(manc$NIR, manc$red, manc$green) manc_rgb %&gt;% plotRGB(.,axes=TRUE, stretch=&quot;lin&quot;) manc_false %&gt;% plotRGB(.,axes=TRUE, stretch=&quot;lin&quot;) 7.8.3 Data similarity What if you wanted to look at signle bands and also check the similarity between bands? # Looking at single bands plot(manc$SWIR2) ## How are these bands different? #set the plot window size (2 by 2) par(mfrow = c(2,2)) #plot the bands plot(manc$blue, main = &quot;Blue&quot;) plot(manc$green, main = &quot;Green&quot;) plot(manc$red, main = &quot;Red&quot;) plot(manc$NIR, main = &quot;NIR&quot;) ## Look at the stats of these bands pairs(manc[[1:7]]) Low statistical significance means that the bands are sufficiently different enough in their wavelength reflectance to show different things in the image. We can also make this look a bit nicer with ggplot2 and GGally library(ggplot2) library(GGally) manc %&gt;% as.data.frame(., na.rm=TRUE)%&gt;% sample_n(., 100)%&gt;% ggpairs(.,axisLabels=&quot;none&quot;) You can do much more using GGally have a look at the great documentation 7.9 Basic raster calculations Now we will move on to some basic advanced raster analysis to compute temperature from this raster data. To do so we need to generate additional raster layers, the first of which is NDVI 7.9.1 NDVI Live green vegetation can be represented with the NIR and Red Bands through the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as chlorophyll reflects in the NIR wavelength, but absorbs in the Red wavelength. \\[NDVI= \\frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red}\\] 7.9.2 NDVI function One of the great strengths of R is that is lets users define their own functions. Here we will practice writing a couple of basic functions to process some of the data we have been working with. One of the benefits of a function is that it generalises some set of operations that can then be repeated over and again on different data the structure of a function in R is given below: myfunction &lt;- function(arg1, arg2, ... ){ statements return(object) } We can use NDVI as an example Lets make a function called NDVIfun NDVIfun &lt;- function(NIR, Red) { NDVI &lt;- (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red) return(NDVI) } Here we have said our function needs two arguments NIR and Red, the next line calcualtes NDVI based on the formula and returns it. To be able to use this function throughout our analysis either copy it into the console or make a new R script, save it in your project then call it within this code using the source() function e.g source(&#39;insert file name&#39;) To use the function do so through ndvi &lt;- NDVIfun(manc$NIR, manc$red) Here we call the function NDVIfun() and then provide the NIR and Red band. Check the output ndvi %&gt;% plot(.,col = rev(terrain.colors(10)), main = &quot;Landsat-NDVI&quot;) # Let&#39;s look at the histogram for this dataset ndvi %&gt;% hist(., breaks = 40, main = &quot;NDVI Histogram&quot;, xlim = c(-.3,.8)) We can reclassify to the raster to show use what is most likely going to vegetation based on the histogram using the 3rd quartile  anything above the 3rd quartile we assume is vegetation. Note, this is an assumption for demonstration purposes, if you were to do something similar in your assignment be sure to provide reasoning with linkage to literature (e.g. policy or academic) veg &lt;- ndvi %&gt;% reclassify(., cbind(-Inf, 0.3, NA)) veg %&gt;% plot(.,main = &#39;Possible Veg cover&#39;) Lets look at this in relation to Manchester as a whole manc_rgb %&gt;% plotRGB(.,axes = TRUE, stretch = &quot;lin&quot;, main = &quot;Landsat True Color Composite&quot;) veg %&gt;% plot(., add=TRUE, legend=FALSE) 7.10 Advanced raster calculations The goal of this final section is to set up a mini investigation to see if there is a relationship between urban area and temperature. If our hypothesis is that there is a relationship then our null is that there is not a relationship 7.10.1 Calucating tempearture from Landsat data Here we are going to compute temperature from Landsat data  there are many methods that can be found within literature to do so but we will use the one originally developed by Artis &amp; Carnahan (1982), recently summarised by Guha et al. 2018 and and Avdan and Jovanovska (2016). Some of the terms used our outlined in the remote sensing background section at the end of the document, so check back there if you get confused. Calcualte the Top of Atmopshere (TOA) spectral radiance from the Digital Number (DN) using: \\[\\lambda= Grescale * QCAL + Brescale\\] TOA spectral radiance is light reflected off the Earth as seen from the satellite measure in radiance units. In this equation Grescale and Brescale represent the gain and bias of the image, with QCAL the Digital Number (DN)  how the raw Landsat image is captured. Grescale and Brescale are available from the .MTL file provided when you downloaded the Landsat data. Either open this file in notepad and extract the required values for band 10 gain (MULT_BAND) and bias (ADD_BAND) Or we can automate it using the MTL() function within the RStoolbox package library(RStoolbox) MTL&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac7_data&quot;, &quot;Lsatdata&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;MTL.txt&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% readMeta() #To see all the attributes head(MTL) Now lets extract the values from the readMTL variable for Band 10we can either use the function getMeta() from RStoolbox of just extract the values ourselves offsetandgain &lt;-MTL %&gt;% getMeta(&quot;B10_dn&quot;, metaData = ., what = &quot;CALRAD&quot;) offsetandgain ## offset gain ## B10_dn 0.1 0.0003342 ##OR offsetandgain &lt;- subset(MTL$CALRAD, rownames(MTL$CALRAD) == &quot;B10_dn&quot;) Run the calculation using the band 10 raster layer TOA &lt;- offsetandgain$gain * lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B10_mask + offsetandgain$offset Next convert the TOA to Brightness Temperature \\(T_b\\) using the following equation: \\[T_b=\\frac{K_2}{ln((K_1/\\lambda)+1)}\\] Brightness temperature is the radiance travelling upward from the top of the atmosphere to the satellite in units of the temperature of an equivalent black body. K1 (774.8853) and K2 (1321.0789) are pre launch calibration constants provided by USGS. Check the handbook for these values Instead of hardcoding these valuesyep, you guessed it we can extract them from our MTL Calidata &lt;- MTL$CALBT%&gt;% as.data.frame()%&gt;% mutate(Band=rownames(.))%&gt;% filter(Band==&quot;B10_dn&quot;) # subset the columns K1 &lt;- Calidata %&gt;% dplyr::select(K1)%&gt;% pull() K2 &lt;- Calidata %&gt;% dplyr::select(K2)%&gt;% pull() Brighttemp &lt;- (K2 / log((K1 / TOA) + 1)) Earlier we calcualted NDVI, lets use that to determine emissivity of each pixel. First we need to calcualte the fractional vegetation of each pixel, through the equation: \\[F_v= \\left( \\frac{NDVI - NDVI_{min}}{NDVI_{max}-NDVI_{min}} \\right)^2\\] facveg &lt;- (ndvi-0.2/0.5-0.2)^2 Fractional vegetation cover is the ratio of vertically projected area of vegetation to the total surface extent. Here, \\(NDVI_{min}\\) is the minimum NDVI value (0.2) where pixels are considered bare earth and \\(NDVI_{max}\\) is the value at which pixels are considered healthy vegetation (0.5) Now compute the emissivity using: \\[\\varepsilon = 0.004*F_v+0.986\\] emiss &lt;- 0.004*facveg+0.986 Emissivity is the ratio absorbed radiation engery to total incoming radiation engery compared to a blackbody (which would absorb everything), being ameasure of absoptivity. Great, were nearly there get our LST following the equation from Weng et al. 2004 (also summarised in Guja et al. (2018) and Avdan and Jovanovska (2016)): \\[LST= \\frac{T_b}{1+(\\lambda \\varrho T_b / (p))ln\\varepsilon}\\] Where: \\[p= h\\frac{c}{\\varrho}\\] Ok, dont freak out.lets start with calculating \\(p\\) Here we have: \\(h\\) which is Planks constant \\(6.626 × 10^-34 Js\\) \\(c\\) which is the velocity of light in a vaccum \\(2.998 × 10^8 m/sec\\) \\(\\varrho\\) which is the Boltzmann constant of \\(1.38 × 10^-23 J/K\\) Boltzmann &lt;- 1.38*10e-23 Plank &lt;- 6.626*10e-34 c &lt;- 2.998*10e8 p &lt;- Plank*(c/Boltzmann) Now for the rest of the equation.we have the values for: \\(\\lambda\\) which is the effective wavelength of our data (10.9 for Landsat 8 band 10) \\(\\varepsilon\\) emissivity \\(T_b\\) Brightness Temperature Run the equation with our data #define remaining varaibles lambda &lt;- 1.09e-5 #run the LST calculation LST &lt;- Brighttemp/(1 +(lambda*Brighttemp/p)*log(emiss)) # check the values LST ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 533, 592, 315536 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 30, 30 (x, y) ## extent : 540915, 558675, 5917125, 5933115 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs ## source : memory ## names : layer ## values : 281.4855, 305.9571 (min, max) Are the values very high? Thats because we are in Kevlin not degrees Celciuslets fix that and plot the map LST &lt;- LST-273.15 plot(LST) Nice thats our temperature data sorted. 7.11 Calucating urban area from Landsat data How about we extract some urban area using another index and then see how our temperature data is related? We will use the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) algorithm for identification of built up regions using the reflective bands: Red, Near-Infrared (NIR) and Mid-Infrared (MIR) originally proposed by Zha et al. (2003). It is very similar to our earlier NDVI calculation but using different bands \\[NDBI= \\frac{Short-wave Infrared (SWIR)-Near Infrared (NIR)}{Short-wave Infrared (SWIR)+Near Infrared (NIR)}\\] In Landsat 8 data the SWIR is band 6 and the NIR band 5 Lets compute this index now NDBI=((lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B6_mask- lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B5_mask)/ (lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B6_mask+ lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B5_mask)) But do you remember our function? Well this is the same calculation we used there just with different raster layers (or bands) so we could reuse it NDBIfunexample &lt;- NDVIfun(lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B6_mask, lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B5_mask) 7.12 Urban area and temperature relationship We could plot the varaibles agaisnt each other but there are a lot of data points plot(values(NDBI), values(LST)) This is termed the overplotting problem. So, lets just take a random subset of the same pixels from both raster layers. To do so we need to again stack our layers # stack the layers computeddata &lt;- LST%&gt;% stack(.,NDBI)%&gt;% as.data.frame()%&gt;% na.omit()%&gt;% # take a random subset sample_n(., 500)%&gt;% dplyr::rename(Temp=&quot;layer.1&quot;, NDBI=&quot;layer.2&quot;) # check the output plot(computeddata$Temp, computeddata$NDBI) Lets jazz things up, load some more packages library(plotly) library(htmlwidgets) Transfrom the data to a data.frame to work with ggplot, then plot heat&lt;-ggplot(computeddata, aes(x = NDBI, y = Temp))+ geom_point(alpha=2, colour = &quot;#51A0D5&quot;)+ labs(x = &quot;Temperature&quot;, y = &quot;Urban index&quot;, title = &quot;Manchester urban and temperature relationship&quot;)+ geom_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=FALSE)+ theme_classic()+ theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # interactive plot ggplotly(heat) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; Its a masterpiece!

However, we would normally report the p-valuewhich we can get from.. p-value: tells us wheather there is a statistically significant correlation between the datasets and if that we can reject the null hypothesis if p&lt;0.05 (there is a 95% chance that the relationship is real). cor: Product moment correlation coefficient conf.low and con.high intervals: 95% confident that the population correlation coeffieicent is within this interval As p&lt;0.05 is shows that are variables are have a statistically significant correlation so as urban area (assuming the index in representative) per pixel increases so does temperaturetherefore we can reject our null hypothesis but remember that this does not imply causation!!

A Pirates Guide to R, chapter 13 on hypothesis tests. 7.14 Considerations If you wanted to explore this type of analysis further then you would need to consider the following: Other methods for extracting temperature from Landsat data Validation of your temperature layer (e.g. weather station data) The formula used to calculate emissivity  there are many The use of raw satellite data as opposed to remove the effects of the atmosphere. Within this practical we have only used relative spatial indexes (e.g. NDVI). However, if you were to use alternative methods it might be more appropraite to use surface reflectance data (also provided by USGS). 7.15 Extension Already an expert with raster data and R? Here we have just looked at one temperature image and concluded that urban area and temperature are realted, but does that hold true for other time periods? If you found this practical straightforward source some Landsat data for an area of interest and create some R code to explore the temporal relationship between urban area and temperature. Or run the analysis with different data and methods. Data: MODIS daily LST: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod11.php MODIS imagery: https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ Methods: Supervised or unsupervised landcover classificaiton: https://rspatial.org/rs/5-supclassification.html# Here you could classify an image into several landcover classes and explore their relationship with temperature 7.16 References Thanks to CASA gradaute student Matt Ng for providing the outline to the start of this practical Avdan, U. and Jovanovska, G., 2016.

The range of possible DN values depends on the sensor radiometric resolution. For example Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM) measures between 0 and 255 (termed 8 bit), whilst Landsat 8 OLI measures between 0 and 65536 (termed 12 bit). These DN values can then be converted into Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance and TOA reflectance through available equations and known constants that are preloaded into certain software. The former is how much light the instrument sees in meaningful units whilst the latter removes the effects of the light source. However, TOA reflectance is still influenced by atmospheric effects. These atmospheric effects can be removed through atmospheric correction achievable in software such as ENVI and QGIS to give surface reflectance representing a ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking it. We must also consider the spectral resolution of satellite imagery, Landsat 8 OLI has 11 spectral bands and as a result is a multi-spectral sensor. As humans we see in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (red-green-blue)  this would be three bands of satellite imagery  however satellites can take advantage of the rest of the spectrum. Each band of Landsat measures in a certain part of the spectrum to produce a DN value. We can then combine these values to produce colour composites. So a true colour composite is where red, green and blue Landsat bands are displayed (the visible spectrum). Based on the differing DN values obtained, we can pick out the unique signatures (values of all spectral bands) of each land cover type, termed spectral signature.

Feel free to follow your own GIS interests, but good places to start include the following: Assignment From weeks 6-9, learn and practice analysis from the course and identify appropriate techniques (from wider research) that might be applicable/relevant to your data. Conduct an extensive methodological review  this could include analysis from within academic literature and/or government departments (or any reputable source). Reading For k-means clustering and exploratory data analysis read Chapter 12 K-Means Clustering from Exploratory Data Analysis with R by Peng (2016).

If you like Welsh, youre in for a treat! 8.3 Part A spatial descriptive statistics 8.3.1 Learning objectives By the end of this practical you should be able to: Create descriptive plots (histograms and boxplots) to help understand the frequency distributions of your data Write custom functions to process your data Produce a location quotient map to highlight interesting (above and below average) patterns in your data Write a function in R to produce a range of different maps based on user inputs Perform a very basic cluster analysis and output the results of a basic geodemographic classification 8.3.2 Getting Started Before we begin this weeks practical, we need to load our packages and carry out some data preparation library(highcharter) library(tidyverse) library(downloader) library(rgdal) library(sf) library(ggplot2) library(reshape2) library(plotly) library(raster) library(downloader) library(rgdal) There is a problem with our London Wards data  we are missing some data relating to housing tenure. The housing tenure data in this file comes from the 2011 Census and visiting http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/ and interrogating Table KS402EW (the Tenure table), we can discover that data for the percentage of shared owners and those living in accommodation rent free are missing. Rather than making you go off to Nomisweb and fetch this data, because Im really nice, Ive posted on GitHub a file containing this and extra categorical, ratio and geographical data that we will need to add to our existing London data file. To download this consult How to download data and files from GitHub, id used Option 1 and its the prac8_data folder you want to download. We can easily join this new data to our original data in R.

Each element should be copied and saved to a word document or something similar: Generate the following from your LondonWardsSF data frame: A simple histogram for a scale/ratio variable of your choice A simple histogram for a scale/ratio variable of your with a different frequency bin-width The same histogram with vertical lines for the mean, median and mode (the mode will be the mid value for the bin with the largest count) and the inter-quartile range. hint  use summary(table$variable) to find the values if you are not sure The same histogram with three different kernel density smoothed frequency gradients A boxplot of the same variable A faceted grid of histograms with for every variable in your London Wards data file. In order to do this, you will need to remove Factor (non-numeric) variables from your dataset and re-shape your data using the melt() function in the reshape2 package (hint  check the help file for melt.data.frame() to understand what the code below is doing). The code below will help you: #check which variables are numeric first Datatypelist &lt;- LondonWardsleftjoin %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% summarise_all(class) %&gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=&quot;All_variables&quot;, values_to=&quot;Variable_class&quot;) #make groups based on types of variables Groups &lt;- LondonWardsleftjoin %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(is.numeric)%&gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=&quot;All_variables&quot;, values_to=&quot;val&quot;)%&gt;% mutate(All_variables = tolower(All_variables))%&gt;% mutate(group = case_when(str_detect(All_variables, &quot;age&quot;) ~ &quot;Age&quot;, str_detect(All_variables, &quot;employ|income|job|jsa&quot;) ~ &quot;Employment&quot;, str_detect(All_variables, &quot;house|rent|detatched|flat|terrace|owned|social|private|share|tax|mortgage&quot;) ~ &quot;Housing&quot;, TRUE~&quot;Other&quot;)) Agehist &lt;- Groups%&gt;% filter(group==&quot;Age&quot;)%&gt;% ggplot(., aes(x=val)) + geom_histogram(aes(x = val, y = ..density..))+ geom_density(colour=&quot;red&quot;, size=1, adjust=1)+ facet_wrap(~All_variables, scales = &#39;free&#39;) To change which group we are plotting, simply alter the filter() argument. Make a note of which variables appear normally distributed and which appear to be skewed. What do the histograms for nominal and ordinal data look like? Try performing a log10() transformation on the x variables and plotting a similar facet grid of histograms  what does this do to some of the skewed variables? For example Agehist &lt;- Groups%&gt;% filter(group==&quot;Age&quot;)%&gt;% ggplot(., aes(x=log10(val))) + geom_histogram(aes(x = val, y = ..density..))+ geom_density(colour=&quot;red&quot;, size=1, adjust=1)+ facet_wrap(~All_variables, scales = &#39;free&#39;) Create a 2D histogram and 2D kernel density estimate of ward centroids in London using the Eastings and Northings data in the x and y columns of your dataset. For example: Londonpoint &lt;- ggplot(LondonWardsleftjoin, aes(x=x.y,y=y.y))+geom_point()+coord_equal() Londonpoint Londonpoint&lt;-ggplot(LondonWardsleftjoin, aes(x=x.y,y=y.y))+stat_bin2d(bins=10) Londonpoint Londonpoint&lt;-ggplot(LondonWardsleftjoin, aes(x=x.y,y=y.y))+geom_point()+coord_equal() Londonpoint Londonpoint+stat_density2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom=&quot;polygon&quot;) 8.3.5 Extension 1 If you really want to go down the road of carrying out KDE in a range of different ways, then this Kernel Density Estimation tutorial  perhaps try it with some of the Blue Plaques data from previous weeks. 8.3.6 Task 2 - Function to recode data In the lecture, it was mentioned that sometimes we should recode variables to reduce the amount of information contained in order that different tests can be carried out on the data. Here we will recode some of our scale/ratio data into some nominal/weak-ordinal data to carry out some basic analysis on. A function to recode data in our dataset might look like the one below: newvar&lt;-0 recode&lt;-function(variable,high,medium,low){ newvar[variable&lt;=high]&lt;-&quot;High&quot; newvar[variable&lt;=medium]&lt;-&quot;Medium&quot; newvar[variable&lt;=low]&lt;-&quot;Low&quot; return(newvar) } 8.3.7 Whats going on in this function? First we initialise a new variable called newvar and set it to = 0. We then define a new function called recode. This takes in 4 pieces of information: A variable (called variable but I could have called it anything) and three values called high, medium and low. It outputs a value to the new string variable newvar based on the values of high, medium and low that are given to the function. To create the function in R, highlight the all of the code in the function and then run the whole block (ctrl-Return in R-Studio). You will see that the function is stored in the workspace. We can now use this function to recode any of our continuous variables into high, medium and low values based on the values we enter into the function. We are going to recode the Average GCSE Score variable into High, Medium and Low values  High will be anything above the 3rd Quartile, Low will be anything below the 1st Quartile and Medium  anything in between. Note, if your data doesnt have the 2013 GCSE scores but 2014, it will have different figures to these figures below and you will need to call the column by the column header you have attach(LondonWards) #Check the name of your column, there could be a slight error and it might be called &#39;AvgGCSED201&#39; summary(AvgGCSE201) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 245.0 332.3 343.7 345.8 358.3 409.1 Create a new column in your data frame and fill it with recoded data for the Average GCSE Score in 2013. To do this, pass the AvgGCSE2013 variable to the recode() function, along with and the three values for high, medium and low. You should create a new variable called gcse_recode and use the function to fill it with values If you wanted to be really fancy, you could try altering the function to calculate these High, Medium and Low LondonWards$GCSE_recode &lt;- recode(AvgGCSE201,409.1,358.3,332.3) #or LondonWards$GCSE_recode &lt;- recode(AvgGCSE201,409.1,358.3,332.3) You should also create a second re-coded variable from the unauthorised absence variable using the same function  call this variable unauth_recode and again, used the 3rd and 1st quartiles to define your high, medium and low values. On to another function. This time, we will calculate some location quotients for housing tenure in London. If you remember, a location quotient is simply the ratio of a local distribution to the ratio of a global distribution. In our case, our global distribution will be London. #Location Quotient function 1 LQ1&lt;-function(pctVariable){ pctVariable /mean(pctVariable) } #Location Quotient function 2 LQ2&lt;-function(variable,rowtotal){ localprop&lt;-variable/rowtotal globalprop&lt;-sum(variable)/sum(rowtotal) return(localprop/globalprop) } The two functions above calculate the same Location Quotient, but the first one works on variables which have already been converted into row percentages, the second will work on raw variables where an additional column for the row totals is stored in a separate column  e.g. age 0-15, age 16-64 and age 65 plus all sum to the Pop2013 column in our data London Wards data set: head(LondonWards[,1:7]) ## Simple feature collection with 6 features and 7 fields ## geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 507996.8 ymin: 170317.9 xmax: 533838 ymax: 182206.1 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid ## WD11CD WD11CDO WD11NM WD11NMW WardName WardCode ## 1 E09000001 00AA City of London &lt;NA&gt; City of London 00AA ## 2 E05000352 00ATGE Feltham West &lt;NA&gt; Hounslow - Feltham West 00ATGE ## 3 E05000353 00ATGF Hanworth &lt;NA&gt; Hounslow - Hanworth 00ATGF ## 4 E05000354 00ATGG Hanworth Park &lt;NA&gt; Hounslow - Hanworth Park 00ATGG ## 5 E05000355 00ATGH Heston Central &lt;NA&gt; Hounslow - Heston Central 00ATGH ## 6 E05000356 00ATGJ Heston East &lt;NA&gt; Hounslow - Heston East 00ATGJ ## Wardcode1 geometry ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((532134.9 18... ## 2 E05000352 MULTIPOLYGON (((509740 1736... ## 3 E05000353 MULTIPOLYGON (((513585.1 17... ## 4 E05000354 MULTIPOLYGON (((512142.6 17... ## 5 E05000355 MULTIPOLYGON (((513098.5 17... ## 6 E05000356 MULTIPOLYGON (((513467.2 17... Calculate Location Quotients for the 5 Housing tenure variables (Owner Occupied, Private Rent, Social Rent, Shared Ownership, Rent Free) in your data set using either of the functions above. Save these as 5 new variables in your dataset. *Hint  use the function to create the variable directly, for example: #this is pseudo code, but you should see how this works dataframe$newLQVariable &lt;- LQ1(originalPercentageVariable) #or dataframe$newLQVariable &lt;- LQ2(originalVariable,rowTotalVariable) 8.3.8 Task 3  Mapping Location Quotients You should now try and create a map or series of maps of your housing tenure location quotients using tmap or ggplot. Try to create a map by referring back earlier practicals in this course and follow the steps from there (or, indeed, use your memory) 8.3.9 Task 4  Creating a Basic Geodemographic Classification As we saw in the lecture, geodemographic classifications are widely used to classify areas according to the characteristics of the population that inhabits them. All geodemographic classifications are created using cluster analysis algorithms. Many of these algorithms exist, but one of the most commonly used is k-means. One of the pitfalls of these algorithms is that they will always find a solution, whether the variables have been selected appropriately or standardised correctly. This means that its very easy to create a classification which is misleading. All of that said, it is useful to see how straightforward it is to create a classification yourself to describe some spatial data you have. In a cluster analysis, you should select variables that are: Ranged on the same scale Normally distributed Not highly correlated To make this task easier, we will just select two variables to make our classification from. In a real geodemographic classification, hundreds of variables are often used.

Lets make our k-means find 3 clusters with 25 iterations. The graphics below by Allison Horst will help explain the process fit &lt;- mydata %&gt;% kmeans(., 3, nstart=25) Now lets get out cluster means using tidy() from the tidymodels package.

I havent even gone into using different clustering algorithms, how to decide on the appropriate number of clusters, using silhoutte plots to assess the strength of the clusters or creating pen-portraits using the variable z-scores for each cluster - this is practically a whole course in its own right or indeed a dissertation topic! 8.4 Part B Online mapping 8.4.1 Learning objectives By the end of this practical you should be able to: Descrbie and explain different methods for producing online maps Create interative maps using RPubs, RMarkdown site generator and Shiny Critically appraise the appropriateness of mapping technqiues based on the dataset and purpose of the output map 8.4.2 Introduction In this practical we are going to preliminary stages of a mini-investigation. Since 2015 the law has capped short-term lets in London at 90 nights per year. However, this is very hard to enforce due to a lack of data and extensive evidence required to prove that the limit has been exceeded. This has been recently reflected in the Housing Research Note 2020/04: Short-term and holiday letting in London by the Greater London Authority (GLA): there are signs that short-term letting platforms are becoming increasingly commercialised and there are concerns that removing housing supply from the market to offer it for short-term letting could be exacerbating Londons housing shortage. The author, Georgie Cosh, was also kind enough to share some of the code used for this report. Guess what! They used R! Have a look at their code in the R file called GLA_airbnb_analysis in the prac8_data folder. Whilst Air bnb have implemented a system the removes listings once they have been rented for 90 days per year unless an appropraite permit is in place we want to interactively visualise the the number of air bnb lettings (and hotels for comparison) per borough as a starting point. This could then be used to undertake further investigation into boroughs with high short term lets, for example exploring other websites to see if the properties are listed and jointly exceed 90 days or optimising localised monitoring. As these rules only apply to entire homes we will only extract only these, and for monitoring purposes (e.g. random annual inspections) those are availbale for 365 days of the year. We will now explore several ways to do this The report by Cosh (2020) goes a bit further than this and implements an occupancy model (based on a number of assumptions) to estimate the number of nights a Air bnb is rented out for, so check it out, perhaps an idea for your final project. 8.4.3 RPubs One of the most straight forward publishing tools is RPubs. It takes an .Rmd and directly uploads it to rpubs.com  all files are publically available on this website. To start with you need to make a free account. Go to: https://rpubs.com/users/new and register Create a new project in RStudio and open a new R Markdown file (File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown) Youll see that the file is automatically populated with some information, have a read through it then click the Knit icon  Lets make some changes to your .Rmd. Delete all the text and code except from header inforamtion (that is enclosed by three dashes at the top of the file) Insert a new code chunk (go back to RMarkdown if you need a refresher) Add add some code of your choice from either a previous practical or your own work. As its a new project youll have to either copy the data into your project folder or set the working directory setwd(). If its all online data that youve loaded directly from the web into R, this shouldnt be an issue. Im going to use the interactive map we made in practical 5 (the Advanced interactive map section)..Here is the code ive put in my chunk: library(sf) library(tmap) library(leafpop) library(leaflet) library(tmaptools) library(tidyverse) OSM &lt;- st_read(here::here(&quot;prac5_data&quot;, &quot;greater-london-latest-free.shp&quot;, &quot;gis_osm_pois_a_free_1.shp&quot;)) %&gt;% st_transform(., 27700) %&gt;% #select hotels only filter(fclass == &#39;hotel&#39;) Londonborough &lt;- st_read(here::here(&quot;Prac1_data&quot;, &quot;statistical-gis-boundaries-london&quot;, &quot;ESRI&quot;, &quot;London_Borough_Excluding_MHW.shp&quot;))%&gt;% st_transform(., 27700) Airbnb &lt;- read_csv(&quot;prac5_data/listings.csv&quot;) %&gt;% st_as_sf(., coords = c(&quot;longitude&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;), crs = 4326) %&gt;% st_transform(., 27700)%&gt;% #select entire places that are available all year filter(room_type == &#39;Entire home/apt&#39; &amp; availability_365 ==&#39;365&#39;) # make a function for the join # hint all you have to do is replace data1 and data2 # with the data you want to use Joinfun &lt;- function(data1, data2){ output&lt;- data1%&gt;% st_join(Londonborough,.)%&gt;% add_count(GSS_CODE, name=&quot;hotels_in_borough&quot;) return(output) } # use the function for hotels Hotels &lt;- Joinfun(OSM, Londonborough) # then for airbnb Airbnb &lt;- Joinfun(Airbnb, Londonborough) # now try to arrange the plots with tmap breaks = c(0, 5, 12, 26, 57, 286) #change the column name from hotels_in_borough for the legend Hotels &lt;- Hotels %&gt;% dplyr::rename(`Accomodation count` = hotels_in_borough) Airbnb &lt;- Airbnb %&gt;% dplyr::rename(`Accomodation count` = hotels_in_borough) Airbnb_count &lt;- Airbnb %&gt;% count(GSS_CODE) Hotels_count &lt;- Hotels %&gt;% count(NAME) #join data Joined &lt;- Airbnb_count%&gt;% st_join(., Hotels_count, join = st_equals)%&gt;% st_transform(., 4326)%&gt;% rename(`Airbnb count` = `n.x`, `GSS Code`= GSS_CODE, `Borough`=NAME, `Hotel count` = `n.y`) popupairbnb &lt;-Joined %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(`Airbnb count`, Borough)%&gt;% popupTable() popuphotel &lt;-Joined %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(`Hotel count`, Borough)%&gt;% popupTable() tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) # set the colour palettes using our previously defined breaks pal1 &lt;- Joined %&gt;% colorBin(palette = &quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain=.$`Airbnb count`, bins=breaks) pal1 &lt;-colorBin(palette = &quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain=Joined$`Airbnb count`, bins=breaks) pal2 &lt;- Joined %&gt;% colorBin(palette = &quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain=.$`Hotel count`, bins=breaks) map&lt;- leaflet(Joined) %&gt;% # add basemap options addTiles(group = &quot;OSM (default)&quot;) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner, group = &quot;Toner&quot;) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = &quot;Toner Lite&quot;) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron, group = &quot;CartoDB&quot;)%&gt;% #add our polygons, linking to the tables we just made addPolygons(color=&quot;white&quot;, weight = 2, opacity = 1, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, popup = popupairbnb, fillOpacity = 0.7, fillColor = ~pal2(`Airbnb count`), group = &quot;Airbnb&quot;)%&gt;% addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal2(`Hotel count`), weight = 2, opacity = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, popup = popupairbnb, fillOpacity = 0.7,group = &quot;Hotels&quot;)%&gt;% # add a legend addLegend(pal = pal2, values = ~`Hotel count`, group = c(&quot;Airbnb&quot;,&quot;Hotel&quot;), position =&quot;bottomleft&quot;, title = &quot;Accomodation count&quot;) %&gt;% # specify layers control addLayersControl( baseGroups = c(&quot;OSM (default)&quot;, &quot;Toner&quot;, &quot;Toner Lite&quot;, &quot;CartoDB&quot;), overlayGroups = c(&quot;Airbnb&quot;, &quot;Hotels&quot;), options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE) ) # plot the map map Add some text at the start of your .Rmd you can include titles and subtitle using # followed by a space, a second level subtitle would be ##, and third ### # Title ## Second sub title ### Third sub title Save the file, Knitt it to HTML, this should be default and specified in the header  enclosed by three dashes.

Make a Git repo in RStudio. Go to Tools &gt; Project Options &gt; Git/SVN and select Git under Version control system and initialize a new repository, then restart RStudio. The Git tab should appear.. Next we need to make a new repository on GitHub. Go to GitHub, login and make a new repository. Make sure that it is empty with no README.. you should have something similar to this appear: Clone the repository by copying the HTTPS Make one local commit. Under the Git tab &gt; Diff &gt; Stage the files &gt; Add a commit message and click commit Now we need to connect our local repository to the GitHub one. So Under the Git tab youll the new brach button (two purple boxes linked to a white box) Click it &gt; Add Remote. Paste in the URL use the remote name origin and the branch name of master  which you can get from the GitHub Quick setup screen after creating your repo. Check sync the branch with the remote &gt; click create then select overwrite Push the files to your GitHub and they will appear on your GitHub repo Next we need to actually build the sitethere are a few ways to do thisGo to the Git tab you should see the Build tab, if you cant then go to Tools &gt; Project Options &gt; Build Tools and select website under Project build tools. Now click Build Website under the build tab Alternatively you write the following in the console rmarkdown::render_site() If you wanted to just build a page from your site  say if you have made a rather big site with lots of analysis use: rmarkdown::render_site(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) Stage, commit and then push the files to your GitHub. I had some issues staging the site_libs folder in the Git tab. I fixed it by closing and reloading my R project then clicking the cog symbol (under Git tab) &gt; Shell and typing git add . If you get an error message about the index file being locked go and delete it and try again. If you cant delete restart the machine and try again. You will find it in the .git folder within your project. Once git add . runs you should see all the files staged, be able to commit and then push the changes to GitHub Help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834014/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-what-is-that-and-is-it-important https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9282632/git-index-lock-file-exists-when-i-try-to-commit-but-cannot-delete-the-file So your built website is up on GitHub, but you need to tell it where to build the site fromGo to your GitHub repo &gt; Settings, scroll down to GitHub pages and select the Source as the master branch Click on the link that is provided where your site is published and you should have a website with two tabs. Here is what mine looks like: For more information on hosting your code from RStudio on GitHub check out the book Happy Git and GitHub for the useR My RMarkdown site can be found at this GitHub pages link, but note that ive added a Shiny tabwhich is covered in an optional extra. At this stage, its important to highlight the need for sensible representations of data and analysis. This especially true with the advent of GitHub and journals publishing data and code meaning it is almost impossible to present false representations of analysis. 8.4.5 Warning Whilst it might seem tempting to use the most advanced interactive maps for your the assignments within this module and course it is important to think and reflect upon the appropriateness of the mapped output. You should ask yourself the following questions: What am i trying to show with this map Will interative elements aid this in anyway or just confuse users Is there a more concise way to display this data Do i need all this information  is it all relevant to the message you are trying to portray with the map In all these examples ive used the same data (Hotels and Airbnbs in London boroughs), however as im only showing two datasets could this be represeted without all this complexity? in this case the answer really depends on the audience you are tyring to get something across to. For example, for use in an academic journal, as there are only two data sets being mapped a static map like we produced in the Map making practical would be more appropraite. However an interative map (similar to what we have produced) might be more useful for incorpation on a website The take home message from this is to critically think about the best way to map and disseminate your data/results. 8.4.6 Advanced online publishing Already familiar with RPubs, RMarkdown site generator or even Shiny? Try and and produce an online document using either: bookdown, flexdashboard, blogdown or shinydashboard. These are listed in order of difficutly from my experience. Hint this document is made using bookdown, so checkout my GitHub for how i set it up Bookdown, minimal bookdown example If you want to extend bookdown or automate the process of building, have a look at continuous integration using github actions Flexdashboard Blogdown Interactive Shiny dashboards 8.5 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form.

In the worked example, we will explore the factors that might affect the average exam scores of 16 year-old across London. GSCEs are the exams taken at the end of secondary education and here have been aggregated for all pupils at their home addresses across the City for Ward geographies. The London Data Store collates a range of other variables for each Ward and so we will see if any of these are able to help explain the patterns of exam performance that we see. This practical will walk you through the common steps that you should go through when building a regression model using spatial data to test a stated research hypothsis; from carrying out some descriptive visualisation and summary statistics, to interpreting the results and using the outputs of the model to inform your next steps. 9.4.1 Setting up your Data First, lets set up R and read in some data to enable us to carry out our analysis. #library a bunch of packages we may (or may not) use - install them first if not installed already. library(tidyverse) library(tmap) library(geojsonio) library(plotly) library(rgdal) library(broom) library(mapview) library(crosstalk) library(sf) library(sp) library(spdep) library(car) library(fs) library(janitor) Read some ward data in #download a zip file containing some boundaries we want to use download.file(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;, destfile=&quot;prac9_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;) Get the zip file and extract it listfiles&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac9_data&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;.zip&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% #print out the .gz file print()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% utils::unzip(exdir=here::here(&quot;prac9_data&quot;)) Look inside the zip and read in the .shp #look what is inside the zip Londonwards&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac9_data&quot;, &quot;statistical-gis-boundaries-london&quot;, &quot;ESRI&quot;))%&gt;% #$ means exact match dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;London_Ward_CityMerged.shp$&quot;))%&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% #read in the file in st_read() ## Reading layer `London_Ward_CityMerged&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\Andy\\OneDrive - University College London\\Teaching\\CASA0005\\2020_2021\\CASA0005repo\\prac9_data\\statistical-gis-boundaries-london\\ESRI\\London_Ward_CityMerged.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 625 features and 7 fields ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 503568.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561957.5 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid #check the data qtm(Londonwards) Now we are going to read in some data from the London Data Store #read in some attribute data LondonWardProfiles &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/ward-profiles-and-atlas/772d2d64-e8c6-46cb-86f9-e52b4c7851bc/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, col_names = TRUE, locale = locale(encoding = &#39;Latin1&#39;)) #check all of the columns have been read in correctly Datatypelist &lt;- LondonWardProfiles %&gt;% summarise_all(class) %&gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=&quot;All_variables&quot;, values_to=&quot;Variable_class&quot;) Datatypelist 9.4.1.1 Cleaning the data as you read it in Examining the dataset as it is read in above, you can see that a number of fields in the dataset that should have been read in as numeric data, have actually been read in as character (text) data. If you examine your data file, you will see why. In a number of columns where data are missing, rather than a blank cell, the values n/a have been entered in instead. Where these text values appear amongst numbers, the software will automatically assume the whole column is text. To deal with these errors, we can force read_csv to ignore these values by telling it what values to look out for that indicate missing data #We can use readr to deal with the issues in this dataset - which are to do with text values being stored in columns containing numeric values #read in some data - couple of things here. Read in specifying a load of likely &#39;n/a&#39; values, also specify Latin1 as encoding as there is a pound sign (£) in one of the column headers - just to make things fun! LondonWardProfiles &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/ward-profiles-and-atlas/772d2d64-e8c6-46cb-86f9-e52b4c7851bc/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv&quot;, na = c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;n/a&quot;), locale = locale(encoding = &#39;Latin1&#39;), col_names = TRUE) #check all of the columns have been read in correctly Datatypelist &lt;- LondonWardProfiles %&gt;% summarise_all(class) %&gt;% pivot_longer(everything(), names_to=&quot;All_variables&quot;, values_to=&quot;Variable_class&quot;) Datatypelist Now you have read in both your boundary data and your attribute data, you need to merge the two together using a common ID. In this case, we can use the ward codes to achieve the join #merge boundaries and data LonWardProfiles &lt;- left_join(Londonwards, LondonWardProfiles, by = c(&quot;GSS_CODE&quot; = &quot;New code&quot;)) #let&#39;s map our dependent variable to see if the join has worked: tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) qtm(LonWardProfiles, fill = &quot;Average GCSE capped point scores - 2014&quot;, borders = NULL, fill.palette = &quot;Blues&quot;) 9.4.1.2 Additional Data In addition to our main datasets, it might also be useful to add some contextual data. While our exam results have been recorded at the home address of students, most students would have attended one of the schools in the City. Lets add some schools data as well. #might be a good idea to see where the secondary schools are in London too london_schools &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/london-schools-atlas/57046151-39a0-45d9-8dc0-27ea7fd02de8/all_schools_xy_2016.csv&quot;) #from the coordinate values stored in the x and y columns, which look like they are latitude and longitude values, create a new points dataset lon_schools_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(london_schools, coords = c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), crs = 4326) lond_sec_schools_sf &lt;- lon_schools_sf %&gt;% filter(PHASE==&quot;Secondary&quot;) tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) qtm(lond_sec_schools_sf) 9.5 Analysing GCSE exam performance - testing a research hypothesis To explore the factors that might influence GCSE exam performance in London, we are going to run a series of different regression models. A regression model is simply the expression of a linear relationship between our outcome variable (Average GCSE score in each Ward in London) and another variable or several variables that might explain this outcome. 9.5.1 Research Question and Hypothesis Examining the spatial distribution of GSCE point scores in the map above, it is clear that there is variation across the city. My research question is: What are the factors that might lead to variation in Average GCSE point scores across the city? My research hypothesis that I am going to test is that there are other observable factors occurring in Wards in London that might affect the average GCSE scores of students living in those areas. In inferential statistics, we cannot definitively prove a hypothesis is true, but we can seek to disprove that there is absolutely nothing of interest occurring or no association between variables. The null hypothesis that I am going to test empirically with some models is that there is no relationship between exam scores and other observed variables across London. 9.5.2 Regression Basics For those of you who know a bit about regression, you might want to skip down to the next section. However, if you are new to regression or would like a refresher, read on The linear relationship in a regression model is probably most easily explained using a scatter plot q &lt;- qplot(x = `Unauthorised Absence in All Schools (%) - 2013`, y = `Average GCSE capped point scores - 2014`, data=LonWardProfiles) #plot with a regression line - note, I&#39;ve added some jitter here as the x-scale is rounded q + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=FALSE, size=1) + geom_jitter() Here, I have plotted the average GCSE point score for each Ward in London against another variable in the dataset that I think might be influential: the % of school days lost to unauthorised absences in each ward. Remember that my null hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between GCSE scores and unauthorised absence from school. If this null hypothesis was true, then I would not expect to see any pattern in the cloud of points plotted above. As it is, the scatter plot shows that, generally, as the \\(x\\) axis independent variable (unauthorised absence) goes up, our \\(y\\) axis dependent variable (GCSE point score) goes down. This is not a random cloud of points, but something that indicates there could be a relationshp here and so I might be looking to reject my null hypothesis. Some conventions - In a regression equation, the dependent variable is always labelled \\(y\\) and shown on the \\(y\\) axis of a graph, the predictor or independent variable(s) is(are) always shown on the \\(x\\) axis. I have added a blue line of best-fit - this is the line that can be drawn by minimising the sum of the squared differences between the line and the residuals. The residuals are all of the dots not falling exactly on the blue line. An algorithm known as ordinary least squares (OLS) is used to draw this line and it simply tries a selection of different lines until the sum of the squared divations between all of the residuals and the blue line is minimised, leaving the final solution. As a general rule, the better the blue line is at summarising the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), the better the model. The equation for the blue line in the graph above can be written: (1)\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] where: \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept (the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\) - somewhere around 370 on the graph above); \\(\\beta_1\\) is sometimes referred to as the slope parameter and is simply the change in the value of \\(y\\) for a 1 unit change in the value of \\(x\\) (the slope of the blue line) - reading the graph above, the change in the value of \\(y\\) reading between 1.0 and 2.0 on the \\(x\\) axis looks to be around -40. \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is a random error term (positive or negative) that should sum to 0 - esentially, if you add all of the vertical differences between the blue line and all of the residuals, it should sum to 0. Any value of \\(y\\) along the blue line can be modelled using the corresponding value of \\(x\\) and these parameter values. Examining the graph above we would expect the average GCSE point score for a student living in a Ward where 0.5% of school days per year were missed, to equal around 350, but we can confirm this by plugging the \\(\\beta\\) parameter values and the value of \\(x\\) into equation (1): 370 + (-40*0.5) + 0 ## [1] 350 9.5.3 Running a Regression Model in R In the graph above, I used a method called lm in the stat_smooth() function in ggplot2 to draw the regression line. lm stands for linear model and is a standard function in R for running linear regression models. Use the help system to find out more about lm - ?lm Below is the code that could be used to draw the blue line in our scatter plot. Note, the tilde ~ symbol means is modelled by.

If our null hypothsis was true, then we would expect our coefficients to = 0. In the output summary of the model above, there are a number of features you should pay attention to: Coefficient Estimates - these are the \\(\\beta_0\\) (intercept) and \\(\\beta_1\\) (slope) parameter estimates from Equation 1. You will notice that at \\(\\beta_0 = 371.471\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = -41.237\\) they are pretty close to the estimates of 370 and -40 that we read from the graph earlier, but more precise. Coefficient Standard Errors - these represent the average amount the coefficient varies from the average value of the dependent variable (its standard deviation). So, for a 1% increase in unauthorised absence from school, while the model says we might expect GSCE scores to drop by -41.2 points, this might vary, on average, by about 1.9 points. As a rule of thumb, we are looking for a lower value in the standard error relative to the size of the coefficient. Coefficient t-value - this is the value of the coefficient divided by the standard error and so can be thought of as a kind of standardised coefficient value. The larger (either positive or negative) the value the greater the relative effect that particular independent variable is having on the dependent variable (this is perhaps more useful when we have several independent variables in the model) . Coefficient p-value - Pr(&gt;|t|) - the p-value is a measure of significance. There is lots of debate about p-values which I wont go into here, but essentially it refers to the probability of getting a coefficient as large as the one observed in a set of random data. p-values can be thought of as percentages, so if we have a p-value of 0.5, then there is a 5% chance that our coefficient could have occurred in some random data, or put another way, a 95% chance that out coefficient could have only occurred in our data. As a rule of thumb, the smaller the p-value, the more significant that variable is in the story and the smaller the chance that the relationship being observed is just random. Generally, statisticians use 5% or 0.05 as the acceptable cut-off for statistical significance - anything greater than that we should be a little sceptical about. In r the codes ***, **, **, . are used to indicate significance. We generally want at least a single * next to our coefficient for it to be worth considering. R-Squared - This can be thought of as an indication of how good your model is - a measure of goodness-of-fit (of which there are a number of others). \\(r^2\\) is quite an intuitite measure of fit as it ranges between 0 and 1 and can be thought of as the % of variation in the dependent variable (in our case GCSE score) explained by variation in the independent variable(s). In our example, an \\(r^2\\) value of 0.42 indicates that around 42% of the variation in GCSE scores can be explained by variation in unathorised absence from school. In other words, this is quite a good model. The \\(r^2\\) value will increase as more independent explanatory variables are added into the model, so where this might be an issue, the adjusted r-squared value can be used to account for this affect 9.5.3.2 broom The output from the linear regression model is messy and like all things R mess can be tidied, in this case with a broom! Or the package broom which is also party of the package tidymodels. Here lets load broom and tidy our outputyou will need to either install tidymodels or broom. The tidy() function will just make a tibble or the statistical findings from the model! library(broom) tidy(model1) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 371. 2.16 172. 0. ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -41.2 1.93 -21.4 1.27e-76 We can also use glance() from broom to get a bit more summary information, such as \\(r^2\\) and the adjusted r-squared value. glance(model1) ## # A tibble: 1 x 12 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.423 0.422 16.4 458. 1.27e-76 1 -2638. 5282. 5296. ## # ... with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt; But wait? Didnt we try to model our GCSE values based on our unauthorised absence variable?

Bootstrap resampling is where we take the original dataset and select random data points from within it, but in order to keep it the same size as the original dataset some records are duplicated. This is known as bootstrap resampling by replacement. So first lets again get rid of all the coloumns we arent using in this model using as they will just slow us down. At the moment we only care about average GCSE scores and unauthorised absecne in schools. Bootstrapdata&lt;- LonWardProfiles%&gt;% clean_names()%&gt;% dplyr::select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013) Next we are going to create our samples using the function bootstraps(). First we set the seed (to any number), which just means are results will be the same if we are to re-run this analysis, if we dont then as we are randomly replacing data the next time we do run the code the results could change. Here we have created 1000 versions of our original data (times=1000). apparent means we are using our entire dataset and the full dataset will be kept in our GSCE_boot variable. set.seed(number) just makes sure we get the same result here each time as it could vary. library(rsample) set.seed(99) GCSE_boot &lt;-st_drop_geometry(Bootstrapdata) %&gt;% bootstraps(times = 1000, apparent = TRUE) slice_tail(GCSE_boot, n=5) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## splits id ## &lt;list&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &lt;split [626/215]&gt; Bootstrap0997 ## 2 &lt;split [626/215]&gt; Bootstrap0998 ## 3 &lt;split [626/233]&gt; Bootstrap0999 ## 4 &lt;split [626/234]&gt; Bootstrap1000 ## 5 &lt;split [626/626]&gt; Apparent So when we look in GSCE_boot we have 1000 rows, plus our apparent data. Here we are now going to run the linear regression model for each of our bootstrap resampled instances. To do this we are going to use the map() function from the purrr package that is also part of the tidyverse. This lets us apply a function (so our regression formula) to a list (so our splits that we calculated from bootstrap resampling) We need to map over and then given the function to what we are mapping over. So we are mapping (or changing) our splits (from the bootstrap resampled) then apply our regression formula to each split. To make sure we can save the output we will create a new column called model with the mutate() function, remember this just lets us add a column to an existing table. GCSE_models &lt;- GCSE_boot %&gt;% #make new column mutate( #column name is model that contains... model = map(splits, ~ lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, data = .))) # let&#39;s look at the first model results GCSE_models$model[[1]] ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, ## data = .) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) ## 372.53 ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 ## -41.48 #if you wanted all of them it&#39;s #GCSE_models$model However, this is a very ugly output and pretty hard to understand. Now remember when we just went through the magic of broom? You might have thought that it didnt do very much! This is where it can really be of use. We want to tidy up our models results so we can actually use them. Firstly lets add a new coloumn with mutate (coef_info) then take our model coloumn and using the map() function again tidy the outputs (saving the result into that new coef_info column). GCSE_models_tidy &lt;- GCSE_models %&gt;% mutate( coef_info = map(model, tidy)) So this has just added the information about our coefficents to a new column in the original table, but what if we actually want to extract this information, well we can just use unnest() from the tidyr package (also part of the tidyverse) that takes a list-column and makes each element its own row. I know its a list column as if you just explore GCSE_models_tidy (just run that in the console) you will see that under coef_info column title it says list.

Well! we can using the int_pctl() from the rsample package, which is also part of tidymodels. Here, we give the function our models (GCSE_models_tidy), tell it what column the statstics are in (coef_info), specify the level of significance (alpha). Now if you recall we set the apparent argument to true earlier on and this is because this is a requirement of int_pctl() library(rsample) int_pctl(GCSE_models_tidy, coef_info, alpha = 0.05) ## # A tibble: 2 x 6 ## term .lower .estimate .upper .alpha .method ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 367. 371. 376. 0.05 percenti~ ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_~ -45.2 -41.2 -37.3 0.05 percenti~ A change in 1% of unathorised absence reduces the average GCSE point score between between 41.2 and 45.2 points (this is our confidence interval) with a 95% confidence level. we can also change alpha to 0.01, which would be the 99% confidence level, but youd expect the confidence interval range to be greater. Here our confidence level means that if we ran the same regression model again with different sample data we could be 95% sure that those values would be within our range here. Confidence interval = the range of values that a future estimate will be betweeen Confidence level = the perctange certainty that a future value will be between our confidence interval values Now lets add our predictions to our original data for a visual comparison, we will do this using the augment() function from the package broom, again we will need to use unnest() too. GCSE_aug &lt;- GCSE_models_tidy %&gt;% #sample_n(5) %&gt;% mutate(augmented = map(model, augment))%&gt;% unnest(augmented) There are so many rows in this tibble as the statistics are produced for each point within our original dataset and then added as an additional row. However, note that the statistics are the same within each bootstrap, we will have a quick look into this now. So we know from our London Ward Profiles layer that we have 626 data points, check this with: length(LonWardProfiles$`Average GCSE capped point scores - 2014`) ## [1] 626 Now, lets have a look at our first bootstrap firstboot&lt;-filter(GCSE_aug,id==&quot;Bootstrap0001&quot;) firstbootlength &lt;- firstboot %&gt;% dplyr::select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% length() #nrow(firstboot) Ok, so how do we know that our coefficient is the same for all 626 points within our first bootstrap? Well we can check all of them, but this would just print the coefficent info for all 262. firstboot$coef_info Another way is just to ask what are the unique values within our coefficient info? uniquecoefficent &lt;- firstboot %&gt;% #select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014) %&gt;% dplyr::select(coef_info)%&gt;% unnest(coef_info)%&gt;% distinct() uniquecoefficent ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 373. 1.92 194. 0. ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -41.5 1.70 -24.4 4.72e-93 #or also this would work #unique(firstboot$coef_info) Right, now it would be really useful if we could plot our original data, but instead of fitting a line of best fit between it we use all the lines from the bootstrap resamples to show the possible variance. ggplot(GCSE_aug, aes(unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014))+ # we want our lines to be from the fitted column grouped by our bootstrap id geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, group = id), alpha = .2, col = &quot;cyan3&quot;) + # remember out apparent data is the original within the bootstrap geom_point(data=filter(GCSE_aug,id==&quot;Apparent&quot;))+ #add some labels to x and y labs(x=&quot;unauthorised absence in all schools 2013 (%)&quot;, y=&quot;Average GCSE capped point scores 2014&quot;) #save the file if you need to #ggsave(&quot;insert_filepath and name&quot;) Youll notice that this plot is slightly different to the one we first produced in Regression Basics as weve used geom_point() not geom_jitter() the latter adds a small amount of random variation to the points (not the data). If change in to geom_point() you will get the same plot as we just produced (apart from the bootstrap fitted lines obviously). 9.5.5 Assumptions Underpinning Linear Regression 9.5.6 Assumption 1 - There is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables The best way to test for this assumption is to plot a scatter plot similar to the one created earlier. It may not always be practical to create a series of scatter plots, so one quick way to check that a linear relationship is probable is to look at the frequency distributions of the variables. If they are normally distributed, then there is a good chance that if the two variables are in some way correlated, this will be a linear relationship. For example, look at the frequency distributions of our two variables earlier: # use Janitor to clean up the names. LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% clean_names() #let&#39;s check the distribution of these variables first ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 5) + geom_density(colour=&quot;red&quot;, size=1, adjust=1) ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.1) + geom_density(colour=&quot;red&quot;, size=1, adjust=1) We would describe both of these distribution as being relatively normally or gaussian disributed, and thus more likely to have a linear correlation (if they are indeed associated). Contrast this with the median house price variable: ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=median_house_price_2014)) + geom_histogram() We would describe this as a not normal and/or positively skewed distribution, i.e. there are more observations towards the lower end of the average house prices observed in the city, however there is a long tail to the distribution, i.e. there are a small number of wards where the average house price is very large indeed. If we plot the raw house price variable against GCSE scores, we get the following scatter plot: qplot(x = median_house_price_2014, y = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, data=LonWardProfiles) This indicates that we do not have a linear relationship, indeed it suggests that this might be a curvilinear relationship. 9.5.6.1 Transforming variables One way that we might be able to achieve a linear relationship between our two variables is to transform the non-normally distributed variable so that it is more normally distributed. There is some debate as to whether this is a wise thing to do as, amongst other things, the coefficients for transformed variables are much harder to interpret, however, we will have a go here to see if it makes a difference. Tukeys ladder of transformations You might be asking how we could go about transforming our variables. In 1977, Tukey described a series of power transformations that could be applied to a variable to alter its frequency distribution. In regression analysis, you analysts will frequently take the log of a variable to change its distribution, but this is a little crude and may not result in a completely normal distribution. For example, we can take the log of the house price variable: ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=log(median_house_price_2014))) + geom_histogram() This looks a little more like a normal distribution, but it is still a little skewed. Fortunately in R, we can use the symbox() function in the car package to try a range of transfomations along Tukeys ladder: symbox(~median_house_price_2014, LonWardProfiles, na.rm=T, powers=seq(-3,3,by=.5)) Observing the plot above, it appears that raising our house price variable to the power of -1 should lead to a more normal distribution: ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=(median_house_price_2014)^-1)) + geom_histogram() qplot(x = (median_house_price_2014)^-1, y = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, data=LonWardProfiles) Compare this with the logged transformation: qplot(x = log(median_house_price_2014), y = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, data=LonWardProfiles) 9.5.6.2 Should I transform my variables? The decision is down to you as the modeller - it might be that a transformation doesnt succeed in normalising the distribtuion of your data or that the interpretation after the transformation is problematic, however it is important not to violate the assumptions underpinning the regression model or your conclusions may be on shaky ground. 9.5.7 Assumption 2 - The residuals in your model should be normally distributed This assumption is easy to check. When we ran our Model1 earlier, one of the outputs stored in our Model 1 object is the residual value for each case (Ward) in your dataset. We can access these values using augment() from broom which will add model output to the original GCSE data We can plot these as a histogram and see if there is a normal distribution: #save the residuals into your dataframe model_data &lt;- model1 %&gt;% augment(., Regressiondata) #plot residuals model_data%&gt;% dplyr::select(.resid)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% qplot()+ geom_histogram() Examining the histogram above, we can be happy that our residuals look to be relatively normally distributed. 9.5.8 Assumption 3 - No Multicolinearity in the independent variables Now, the regression model we have be experimenting with so far is a simple bivariate (two variable) model. One of the nice things about regression modelling is while we can only easily visualise linear relationships in a two (or maximum 3) dimension scatter plot, mathematically, we can have as many dimensions / variables as we like. As such, we could extend model 1 into a multiple regression model by adding some more explanatory variables that we think could affect GSCE scores. Lets try the log or ^-1 transformed house price variable from earlier (the rationalle being that higher house prices indicate more affluence and therefore, potentially, more engagement with education): Regressiondata2&lt;- LonWardProfiles%&gt;% clean_names()%&gt;% dplyr::select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, median_house_price_2014) model2 &lt;- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014), data = Regressiondata2) #show the summary of those outputs tidy(model2) ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 202. 20.1 10.0 4.79e-22 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -36.2 1.92 -18.9 3.71e-63 ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 12.8 1.50 8.50 1.37e-16 glance(model2) ## # A tibble: 1 x 12 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.483 0.482 15.5 291. 4.78e-90 2 -2604. 5215. 5233. ## # ... with 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt; #and for future use, write the residuals out model_data2 &lt;- model2 %&gt;% augment(., Regressiondata2) # also add them to the shapelayer LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(model2resids = residuals(model2)) Examining the output above, it is clear that including median house price into our model improves the fit from an \\(r^2\\) of around 42% to an \\(r^2\\) of 48%. Median house price is also a statistically significant variable. But do our two explanatory variables satisfy the no-multicoliniarity assumption? If not and the variables are highly correlated, then we are effectively double counting the influence of these variables and overstating their explanatory power. To check this, we can compute the product moment correlation coefficient between the variables, using the corrr() pacakge, thats part of tidymodels. In an ideal world, we would be looking for something less than a 0.8 correlation library(corrr) Correlation &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, median_house_price_2014) %&gt;% mutate(median_house_price_2014 =log(median_house_price_2014))%&gt;% correlate() %&gt;% # just focus on GCSE and house prices focus(-average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, mirror = TRUE) #visualise the correlation matrix rplot(Correlation) Looking at either the correlation matrix or the correlation plot of that matrix, its easy to see that there is a low correlation (around 30%) between our two independent variables. Multiple linear regression can be explained nicely with this example from allison_horst. Lets meet our Multiple Linear Regression teaching assistants: Here my reseach question might be What are the factors that might lead to variation in dragon weight? We might have both cateogrical predictor variaibles such as if the dragon is spotted then they might weight 0.6 more tons than on averageSo if the dragon is not spotted then in the equation bellow 0.6 x (0)  0 as its not spotted, it would be 1 if spotted is 0 so the weight would be 2.4 tonnes. But we could also have a continuous predictor variable here a 1 foot taller dragon would have an addtional 0.3 tonnes on average, as the equation would be 2.4 + 0.3(1) We can use these equations to make predicitons about a new dragonhere the dragon is striped, so spotted equals 0, and its height is 5.1. So that gives us 2.4 + (0.3*5.1) which equals 3.9 tonnes. However, we need to check the residuals  difference between the predicted weight and acutal weighthere its 0.3 tonnes as the actual weight of the dragon was 4.2 tonnes. Then for all the dragons we need to make sure these resisuals are normally distributed, but you should also check all the other assumptions (1-5) shown within this practical and give brief evdience in reports that they are all valid. 9.5.8.1 Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Another way that we can check for Multicolinearity is to examine the VIF for the model. If we have VIF values for any variable exceeding 10, then we may need to worry and perhaps remove that variable from the analysis: vif(model2) ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 ## 1.105044 ## log(median_house_price_2014) ## 1.105044 Both the correlation plots and examination of VIF indicate that our multiple regression model meets the assumptions around multicollinearity and so we can proceed further. If we wanted to add more variables into our model, it would be useful to check for multicollinearity amongst every variable we want to include, we can do this by computing a correlation matrix for the whole dataset or checking the VIF after running the model: position &lt;- c(10:74) Correlation_all&lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(position)%&gt;% correlate() rplot(Correlation_all) 9.5.9 Assumption 4 - Homoscedasticity Homoscedasticity means that the errors/residuals in the model exhibit constant / homogenous variance, if they dont, then we would say that there is hetroscedasticity present. Why does this matter? Andy Field does a much better job of explaining this than I could ever do here - https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/tag/homoscedasticity/ - but essentially, if your errors do not have constant variance, then your parameter estimates could be wrong, as could the estimates of their significance. The best way to check for homo/hetroscedasticity is to plot the residuals in the model against the predicted values. We are looking for a cloud of points with no apparent patterning to them. #print some model diagnositcs. par(mfrow=c(2,2)) #plot to 2 by 2 array plot(model2) In the series of plots above, the first plot (residuals vs fitted), we would hope to find a random cloud of points with a straight horizontal red line. Looking at the plot, the curved red line would suggest some hetroscedasticity, but the cloud looks quite random. Similarly we are looking for a random cloud of points with no apparent patterning or shape in the third plot of standardised residuals vs fitted values. Here, the cloud of points also looks fairly random, with perhaps some shaping indicated by the red line. 9.5.10 Assumption 5 - Independence of Errors This assumption simply states that the residual values (errors) in your model must not be correlated in any way. If they are, then they exhibit autocorrelation which suggests that something might be going on in the background that we have not sufficiently accounted for in our model. 9.5.10.1 Standard Autocorrelation If you are running a regression model on data that do not have explicit space or time dimensions, then the standard test for autocorrelation would be the Durbin-Watson test. This tests whether residuals are correlated and produces a summary statistic that ranges between 0 and 4, with 2 signifiying no autocorrelation. A value greater than 2 suggesting negative autocorrelation and and value of less than 2 indicating postitve autocorrelation. In his excellent text book, Andy Field suggests that you should be concerned with Durbin-Watson test statistics &lt;1 or &gt;3. So lets see: #run durbin-watson test DW &lt;- durbinWatsonTest(model2) tidy(DW) ## # A tibble: 1 x 5 ## statistic p.value autocorrelation method alternative ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1.61 0 0.193 Durbin-Watson Test two.sided As you can see, the DW statistics for our model is 1.61, so some indication of autocorrelation, but perhaps nothing to worry about. HOWEVER We are using spatially referenced data and as such we should check for spatial-autocorrelation. The first test we should carry out is to map the residuals to see if there are any apparent obvious patterns: #now plot the residuals tmap_mode(&quot;view&quot;) #qtm(LonWardProfiles, fill = &quot;model1_resids&quot;) tm_shape(LonWardProfiles) + tm_polygons(&quot;model2resids&quot;, palette = &quot;RdYlBu&quot;) + tm_shape(lond_sec_schools_sf) + tm_dots(col = &quot;TYPE&quot;) Looking at the map above, there look to be some blue areas next to other blue areas and some red/orange areas next to other red/orange areas. This suggests that there could well be some spatial autocorrelation biasing our model, but can we test for spatial autocorrelation more systematically? Yes - and some of you will remember this from the practical two weeks ago. We can calculate a number of different statistics to check for spatial autocorrelation - the most common of these being Morans I. Lets do that now. #calculate the centroids of all Wards in London coordsW &lt;- LonWardProfiles%&gt;% st_centroid()%&gt;% st_geometry() ## Warning in st_centroid.sf(.): st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over ## geometries of x plot(coordsW) #Now we need to generate a spatial weights matrix (remember from the lecture a couple of weeks ago).

Remembering that Morans I ranges from between -1 and +1 (0 indicating no spatial autocorrelation) we can conclude that there is some weak to moderate spatial autocorrelation in our residuals. This means that despite passing most of the assumptions of linear regression, we could have a situation here where the presence of some spatial autocorrelation could be leading to biased estimates of our parameters and significance values. 9.6 Spatial Regression Models 9.6.1 Dealing with Spatially Autocorrelated Residuals - Spatial Lag and Spatial Error models 9.6.1.1 The Spatial Lag (lagged dependent variable) model In the example models we ran above we were testing the null-hypothesis that there is no relationship between the average GCSE scores recorded for secondary school pupils in different Wards in London and other explanatory variables. Running regression models that tested the effects of absence from school and average house price, early indications were that we could reject this null-hypothsis as the regression models ran indicated that close to 50% of the variation in GCSE scores could be explained by variations in unauthorised absence from school and average house prices. However, running a Morans I test on the residuals from the model suggested that there might be some spatial autocorreation occurring suggesting that places where the model over-predicted GCSE scores (those shown in blue in the map above with negative residuals) and under-predicted (those shown in red/orange) occasionally were near to each other. Overlaying the locations of secondary schools in London onto the map reveals why this could be the case. Many of the schools in London lie on or near the bounaries of the wards that pupils will live in. Therefore, it is likely that pupils attending a school could come from a number of neighbouring wards. As such the average GCSE score in one ward could be related to that in another as the pupils living in these wards may be attending the same school. This could be the source of the autocorrelation. Ward and Gleditsch (2008) describe this situation (where the value of our \\(y\\) dependent variable - GCSE scores - may be influenced by neighbouring values) and suggest the way to deal with it is to incorporate a spatially-lagged version of this variable amongst the independent variables on the right-hand side of the equation. In this case, Equation 1 would be updated to look like this: (2)\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\rho w_i.y_i + \\epsilon_i\\] In this equation, \\(w\\) is the spatial weights matrix you generated and \\(w_i\\) is vector of all neighbouring areas (in our case, Wards) for any Ward \\(y_i\\). In this model, a positive value for the \\(\\rho w_i.y_i\\) parameter would indicate that the average value for GCSE scores is expected to be higher if, on average, Wards neighbouring also have higher GCSE score values. For more details on running a spatially lagged regression model and interpreting the outputs, see the chapter on spatially lagged models by Ward and Gleditsch (2008) available online here: https://methods.sagepub.com/book/spatial-regression-models/n2.xml Lets run the original model again to remind ourselves of the paramters: #Original Model model2 &lt;- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014), data = LonWardProfiles) tidy(model2) ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 202. 20.1 10.0 4.79e-22 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -36.2 1.92 -18.9 3.71e-63 ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 12.8 1.50 8.50 1.37e-16 library(spatialreg) #run a spatially-lagged regression model with a queen&#39;s case weights matrix slag_dv_model2_queen &lt;- lagsarlm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014), data = LonWardProfiles, nb2listw(LWard_nb, style=&quot;C&quot;), method = &quot;eigen&quot;) #what do the outputs show? tidy(slag_dv_model2_queen) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 rho 5.16e-3 0.00759 0.679 4.97e- 1 ## 2 (Intercept) 2.02e+2 20.1 10.1 0. ## 3 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -3.62e+1 1.91 -18.9 0. ## 4 log(median_house_price_2014) 1.26e+1 1.53 8.21 2.22e-16 Running the spatially-lagged model with a Queens case spatial weights matrix reveals that in this example, there is an insignificant and small effect associated with the spatially lagged dependent variable. However, a different conception of neighbours we might get a different outcome #run a spatially-lagged regression model slag_dv_model2_knn4 &lt;- lagsarlm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014), data = LonWardProfiles, nb2listw(LWard_knn, style=&quot;C&quot;), method = &quot;eigen&quot;) #what do the outputs show? tidy(slag_dv_model2_knn4) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 rho 0.374 0.0409 9.14 0. ## 2 (Intercept) 116. 20.1 5.76 8.39e- 9 ## 3 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -28.5 1.97 -14.5 0. ## 4 log(median_house_price_2014) 9.29 1.48 6.28 3.36e-10 Using the 4 nearest neighbours instead of just considering all adjcent zones in the spatial weights matrix, the size and significance of the spatially lagged term changes quite dramatically. In the 4 nearest neighbour model it is both quite large, postitive and statistically significant (&lt;0.05), conversely the effects of unauthorised absence and median house-price are reduced. What this means is that in our study area, the average GCSE score recorded in Wards across the city varies partially with the average GCSE score found in neighbouring Wards. Given the distribution of schools in the captial in relation to where pupils live, this makes sense as schools might draw pupils from a few close neighbouring wards rather than all neighbour bordering a particular Ward. Effectively, by ignoring the effects of spatial autocorrelation in the original OLS model, the impacts of unauthorised absence and affluence (as represented by average house price) were slightly overplayed. We can also now check that the residuals from the spatially lagged model are now no-longer exhibiting spatial autocorrelation: #write out the residuals LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(slag_dv_model2_knn_resids = residuals(slag_dv_model2_knn4)) KNN4Moran &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(slag_dv_model2_knn_resids)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% moran.test(., Lward.knn_4_weight)%&gt;% tidy() KNN4Moran ## # A tibble: 1 x 7 ## estimate1 estimate2 estimate3 statistic p.value method alternative ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 0.0468 -0.0016 0.000717 1.81 0.0353 Moran I test unde~ greater 9.6.1.2 The Spatial Error Model Another way of coneptualising spatial dependence in regression models is not through values of the dependent variable in some areas affecting those in neighbouring areas (as they do in the spatial lag model), but in treating the spatial autocorrelation in the residuals as something that we need to deal with, perhaps reflecting some spatial autocorrelation amongst unobserved independent variables or some other mis-specification of the model. Ward and Gleditsch (2008) characterise this model as seeing spatial autocorrelation as a nuisance rather than being particularly informative, however it can still be handled within the model, albeit slightly differently. The spatial error model can be written: (3)\\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + \\lambda w_i.\\xi_i + \\epsilon_i\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a measure of the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals for neighbouring residuals and \\(\\xi_i\\) is the spatial component of the error term If there is no spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, we would expect the \\(\\lambda\\) parameter to = 0 and the other parameters in the regression equation would be the same as in the OLS regression. For more detail on the spatial error model, see Ward and Gleditsch (2008) - https://methods.sagepub.com/Book/spatial-regression-models/n3.xml We can run a spatial error model on the same data below: sem_model1 &lt;- errorsarlm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014), data = LonWardProfiles, nb2listw(LWard_knn, style=&quot;C&quot;), method = &quot;eigen&quot;) tidy(sem_model1) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 154. 28.2 5.44 5.28e- 8 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -32.3 2.22 -14.5 0. ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 16.2 2.12 7.62 2.55e-14 ## 4 lambda 0.475 0.0451 10.5 0. Comparing the results of the spatial error model with the spatially lagged model and the original OLS model, the suggestion here is that the spatially correlated errors in residuals lead to an over-estimate of the importance of unauthorised absence in the OLS model and an under-estimate of the importance of affluence, represented by median house prices. Conversely, the spatial error model estimates higher parameter values for both variables when compared to the spatially lagged model. Both the \\(\\lambda\\) parameter in the spatial error model and the \\(\\rho\\) parameter in the spatially lagged model are larger than their standard errors, so we can conclude that spatial dependence should be borne in mind when interpreteing the results of this regression model. 9.6.2 Spatial regression model in R We will now read in some extra data which we will use shortly extradata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qay9q1jwpffxcqj/LondonAdditionalDataFixed.csv?raw=1&quot;) #add the extra data too LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles%&gt;% left_join(., extradata, by = c(&quot;gss_code&quot; = &quot;Wardcode&quot;))%&gt;% clean_names() #print some of the column names LonWardProfiles%&gt;% names()%&gt;% tail(., n=10) ## [1] &quot;ward_code&quot; &quot;pct_shared_ownership2011&quot; ## [3] &quot;pct_rent_free2011&quot; &quot;candidate&quot; ## [5] &quot;inner_outer&quot; &quot;x&quot; ## [7] &quot;y&quot; &quot;avg_gcse2011&quot; ## [9] &quot;unauth_absence_schools11&quot; &quot;geometry&quot; 9.6.3 Extending your regression model - Dummy Variables What if instead of fitting one line to our cloud of points, we could fit several depending on whether the Wards we were analysing fell into some or other group. What if the relationship between attending school and achieving good exam results varied between inner and outer London, for example. Could we test for that? Well yes we can - quite easily in fact. If we colour the points representing Wards for Inner and Outer London differently, we can start to see that there might be something interesting going on. Using 2011 data (as there are not the rounding errors that there are in the more recent data), there seems to be a stronger relationship between absence and GCSE scores in Outer London than Inner London. We can test for this in a standard linear regression model. p &lt;- ggplot(LonWardProfiles, aes(x=unauth_absence_schools11, y=average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014)) p + geom_point(aes(colour = inner_outer)) Dummy variables are always categorical data (inner or outer London, or red / blue etc.). When we incorporate them into a regression model, they serve the purpose of splitting our analysis into groups. In the graph above, it would mean, effectively, having a separate regression line for the red points and a separate line for the blue points. Lets try it! #first, let&#39;s make sure R is reading our InnerOuter variable as a factor #see what it is at the moment... isitfactor &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% dplyr::select(inner_outer)%&gt;% summarise_all(class) isitfactor ## Simple feature collection with 2 features and 1 field ## geometry type: POLYGON ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 503568.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561957.5 ymax: 200933.9 ## projected CRS: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid ## inner_outer geometry ## 1 character POLYGON ((532745.1 157404.6... ## 2 character POLYGON ((532745.1 157404.6... # change to factor LonWardProfiles&lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(inner_outer=as.factor(inner_outer)) #now run the model model3 &lt;- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer, data = LonWardProfiles) tidy(model3) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 97.6 24.1 4.06 5.62e- 5 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -30.1 2.03 -14.8 7.02e-43 ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 19.8 1.74 11.4 2.09e-27 ## 4 inner_outerOuter 10.9 1.51 7.24 1.30e-12 So how can we interpret this? Well, the dummy variable is statistically significant and the coefficient tells us the difference between the two groups (Inner and Outer London) we are comparing. In this case, it is telling us that living in a Ward in outer London will improve your average GCSE score by 10.93 points, on average, compared to if you lived in Inner London. The R-squared has increased slightly, but not by much. You will notice that despite there being two values in our dummy variable (Inner and Outer), we only get one coefficient. This is because with dummy variables, one value is always considered to be the control (comparison/reference) group. In this case we are comparing Outer London to Inner London. If our dummy variable had more than 2 levels we would have more coefficients, but always one as the reference. The order in which the dummy comparisons are made is determined by what is known as a contrast matrix. This determines the treatment group (1) and the control (reference) group (0). We can view the contrast matrix using the contrasts() function: contrasts(LonWardProfiles$inner_outer) ## Outer ## Inner 0 ## Outer 1 If we want to change the reference group, there are various ways of doing this. We can use the contrasts() function, or we can use the relevel() function. Lets try it: LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(inner_outer = relevel(inner_outer, ref=&quot;Outer&quot;)) model3 &lt;- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer, data = LonWardProfiles) tidy(model3) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 109. 23.2 4.68 3.53e- 6 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -30.1 2.03 -14.8 7.02e-43 ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 19.8 1.74 11.4 2.09e-27 ## 4 inner_outerInner -10.9 1.51 -7.24 1.30e-12 You will notice that the only thing that has changed in the model is that the coefficient for the inner_outer variable now relates to Inner London and is now negative (meaning that living in Inner London is likely to reduce your average GCSE score by 10.93 points compared to Outer London). The rest of the model is exactly the same. 9.6.4 TASK: Investigating Further - Adding More Explanatory Variables into a multiple regression model Now its your turn. You have been shown how you could begin to model average GCSE scores across London, but the models we have built so far have been fairly simple in terms of explanatory variables. You should try and build the optimum model of GCSE performance from your data in your LondonWards dataset. Experiment with adding different variables - when building a regression model in this way, you are trying to hit a sweet spot between increasing your R-squared value as much as possible, but with as few explanatory variables as possible. 9.6.4.1 A few things to watch out for You should never just throw variables at a model without a good theoretical reason for why they might have an influence. Choose your variables carefully! Be prepared to take variables out of your model either if a new variable confounds (becomes more important than) earlier variables or turns out not to be significant. For example, lets try adding the rate of drugs related crime (logged as it is a positively skewed variable, where as the log is normal) and the number of cars per household are these variables significant? What happens to the spatial errors in your models? 9.7 Task 3 - Spatial Non-stationarity and Geographically Weighted Regression Models (GWR) Heres my final model from the last section: #select some variables from the data file myvars &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% dplyr::select(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014, unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, median_house_price_2014, rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015, percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011, inner_outer) #check their correlations are OK Correlation_myvars &lt;- myvars %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(-inner_outer)%&gt;% correlate() #run a final OLS model model_final &lt;- lm(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer + rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 + percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011, data = myvars) tidy(model_final) ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 240. 27.9 8.59 7.02e-17 ## 2 unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_per~ -23.6 2.16 -10.9 1.53e-25 ## 3 log(median_house_price_2014) 8.41 2.26 3.72 2.18e- 4 ## 4 inner_outerInner -10.4 1.65 -6.30 5.71e-10 ## 5 rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claim~ -2.81 0.635 -4.43 1.12e- 5 ## 6 percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and~ 0.413 0.0784 5.27 1.91e- 7 LonWardProfiles &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(model_final_res = residuals(model_final)) par(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(model_final) qtm(LonWardProfiles, fill = &quot;model_final_res&quot;) final_model_Moran &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(model_final_res)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% moran.test(., Lward.knn_4_weight)%&gt;% tidy() final_model_Moran ## # A tibble: 1 x 7 ## estimate1 estimate2 estimate3 statistic p.value method alternative ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 0.224 -0.0016 0.000718 8.42 1.91e-17 Moran I test und~ greater Now, we probably could stop at running a spatial error model at this point, but it could be that rather than spatial autocorrelation causing problems with our model, it might be that a global regression model does not capture the full story. In some parts of our study area, the relationships between the dependent and independent variable may not exhibit the same slope coefficient. While, for example, increases in unauthorised absence usually are negatively correlated with GCSE score (students missing school results in lower exam scores), in some parts of the city, they could be positively correlated (in affluent parts of the city, rich parents may enrol their children for just part of the year and then live elsewhere in the world for another part of the year, leading to inflated unauthorised absence figures. Ski holidays are cheaper during the school term, but the pupils will still have all of the other advantages of living in a well off household that will benefit their exam scores. If this occurs, then we have non-stationarity - this is when the global model does not represent the relationships between variables that might vary locally. This part of the practical will only skirt the edges of GWR, for much more detail you should visit the GWR website which is produced and maintained by Prof Chris Brunsdon and Dr Martin Charlton who originally developed the technique - http://gwr.nuim.ie/ There are various packages which will carry out GWR in R, for this pracical we we use spgwr (mainly because it was the first one I came across), although you could also use GWmodel or gwrr. I should also acknowledge the guide on GWR produced by the University of Bristol, which was a great help when producing this exercise. However, to use spgwr we need to convert our data from sf to sp format, this is simply done using as(data, \"Spatial\") !!!HERE!!! library(spgwr) st_crs(LonWardProfiles) = 27700 ## Warning: st_crs&lt;- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for ## that LonWardProfilesSP &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% as(., &quot;Spatial&quot;) ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = &quot;PROJ&quot;, multiline = &quot;NO&quot;): Discarded ## datum Unknown based on Airy 1830 ellipsoid in CRS definition st_crs(coordsW) = 27700 ## Warning: st_crs&lt;- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for ## that coordsWSP &lt;- coordsW %&gt;% as(., &quot;Spatial&quot;) ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = &quot;PROJ&quot;, multiline = &quot;NO&quot;): Discarded ## datum Unknown based on Airy 1830 ellipsoid in CRS definition coordsWSP ## class : SpatialPoints ## features : 626 ## extent : 505215.1, 557696.2, 157877.7, 199314 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## Warning in proj4string(x): CRS object has comment, which is lost in output ## crs : +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +units=m +no_defs #calculate kernel bandwidth GWRbandwidth &lt;- gwr.sel(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer + rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 + percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011, data = LonWardProfilesSP, coords=coordsWSP, adapt=T) ## Warning in gwr.sel(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + : data is Spatial* object, ## ignoring coords argument ## Adaptive q: 0.381966 CV score: 124832.2 ## Adaptive q: 0.618034 CV score: 126396.1 ## Adaptive q: 0.236068 CV score: 122752.4 ## Adaptive q: 0.145898 CV score: 119960.5 ## Adaptive q: 0.09016994 CV score: 116484.6 ## Adaptive q: 0.05572809 CV score: 112628.7 ## Adaptive q: 0.03444185 CV score: 109427.7 ## Adaptive q: 0.02128624 CV score: 107562.9 ## Adaptive q: 0.01315562 CV score: 108373.2 ## Adaptive q: 0.02161461 CV score: 107576.6 ## Adaptive q: 0.0202037 CV score: 107505.1 ## Adaptive q: 0.01751157 CV score: 107333 ## Adaptive q: 0.01584775 CV score: 107175.5 ## Adaptive q: 0.01481944 CV score: 107564.8 ## Adaptive q: 0.01648327 CV score: 107187.9 ## Adaptive q: 0.01603246 CV score: 107143.9 ## Adaptive q: 0.01614248 CV score: 107153.1 ## Adaptive q: 0.01607315 CV score: 107147.2 ## Adaptive q: 0.01596191 CV score: 107143 ## Adaptive q: 0.01592122 CV score: 107154.4 ## Adaptive q: 0.01596191 CV score: 107143 #run the gwr model gwr.model = gwr(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer + rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 + percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011, data = LonWardProfilesSP, coords=coordsWSP, adapt=GWRbandwidth, hatmatrix=TRUE, se.fit=TRUE) ## Warning in gwr(average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + : data is Spatial* object, ## ignoring coords argument ## Warning in proj4string(data): CRS object has comment, which is lost in output ## Warning in sqrt(betase): NaNs produced ## Warning in sqrt(betase): NaNs produced ## Warning in showSRID(uprojargs, format = &quot;PROJ&quot;, multiline = &quot;NO&quot;): Discarded ## datum Unknown based on Airy 1830 ellipsoid in CRS definition #print the results of the model gwr.model ## Call: ## gwr(formula = average_gcse_capped_point_scores_2014 ~ unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 + ## log(median_house_price_2014) + inner_outer + rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 + ## percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011, data = LonWardProfilesSP, ## coords = coordsWSP, adapt = GWRbandwidth, hatmatrix = TRUE, ## se.fit = TRUE) ## Kernel function: gwr.Gauss ## Adaptive quantile: 0.01596191 (about 9 of 626 data points) ## Summary of GWR coefficient estimates at data points: ## Warning in print.gwr(x): NAs in coefficients dropped ## Min. 1st Qu. ## X.Intercept. -345.01649 -14.73075 ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 -47.06120 -31.08397 ## log.median_house_price_2014. -0.55994 11.18979 ## inner_outerInner -24.36827 -10.44459 ## rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 1.43895 10.72734 ## percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011 -0.06701 0.49946 ## Median 3rd Qu. ## X.Intercept. 81.81663 179.15965 ## unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013 -14.04901 -5.00033 ## log.median_house_price_2014. 18.00032 22.78750 ## inner_outerInner -6.58838 -3.33210 ## rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015 16.11748 26.08932 ## percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011 0.72555 1.07515 ## Max.

You will see how the global coefficients are exactly the same as the coefficients in the earlier lm model. In this particular model (yours will look a little different if you have used different explanatory variables), if we take unauthorised absence from school, we can see that the coefficients range from a minimum value of -47.06 (1 unit change in unauthorised absence resulting in a drop in average GCSE score of -47.06) to +6.8 (1 unit change in unauthorised absence resulting in an increase in average GCSE score of +6.8). For half of the wards in the dataset, as unauthorised absence rises by 1 point, GCSE scores will decrease between -30.80 and -14.34 points (the inter-quartile range between the 1st Qu and the 3rd Qu). You will notice that the R-Squared value has improved - this is not uncommon for GWR models, but it doesnt necessarily mean they are definitely better than global models. The small number of cases under the kernel means that GW models have been criticised for lacking statistical robustness. Coefficient ranges can also be seen for the other variables and they suggest some interesting spatial patterning. To explore this we can plot the GWR coefficients for different variables. Firstly we can attach the coefficients to our original dataframe - this can be achieved simply as the coefficients for each ward appear in the same order in our spatial points dataframe as they do in the original dataframe. results &lt;- as.data.frame(gwr.model$SDF) names(results) ## [1] &quot;sum.w&quot; ## [2] &quot;X.Intercept.&quot; ## [3] &quot;unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013&quot; ## [4] &quot;log.median_house_price_2014.&quot; ## [5] &quot;inner_outerInner&quot; ## [6] &quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015&quot; ## [7] &quot;percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011&quot; ## [8] &quot;X.Intercept._se&quot; ## [9] &quot;unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013_se&quot; ## [10] &quot;log.median_house_price_2014._se&quot; ## [11] &quot;inner_outerInner_se&quot; ## [12] &quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015_se&quot; ## [13] &quot;percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011_se&quot; ## [14] &quot;gwr.e&quot; ## [15] &quot;pred&quot; ## [16] &quot;pred.se&quot; ## [17] &quot;localR2&quot; ## [18] &quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015_EDF&quot; ## [19] &quot;X.Intercept._se_EDF&quot; ## [20] &quot;unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013_se_EDF&quot; ## [21] &quot;log.median_house_price_2014._se_EDF&quot; ## [22] &quot;inner_outerInner_se_EDF&quot; ## [23] &quot;rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015_se_EDF&quot; ## [24] &quot;percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011_se_EDF&quot; ## [25] &quot;pred.se.1&quot; #attach coefficients to original SF LonWardProfiles2 &lt;- LonWardProfiles %&gt;% mutate(coefUnauthAbs = results$unauthorised_absence_in_all_schools_percent_2013, coefHousePrice = results$log.median_house_price_2014., coefJSA = rate_of_job_seekers_allowance_jsa_claimants_2015, coefLev4Qual = percent_with_level_4_qualifications_and_above_2011) tm_shape(LonWardProfiles2) + tm_polygons(col = &quot;coefUnauthAbs&quot;, palette = &quot;RdBu&quot;, alpha = 0.5) Now how would you plot the House price coeffeicent, Job seekers allowance and level 4 qualification coefficient? Taking the first plot, which is for the unauthorised absence coefficients, we can see that for the majority of boroughs in London, there is the negative relationship we would expect - i.e. as unauthorised absence goes up, exam scores go down. For three boroughs (Westminster, Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as an area near Bexleyheath in South East London - some of the richest in London), however, the relationship is positive - as unauthorised school absence increases, so does average GCSE score. This is a very interesting pattern and counterintuitive pattern, but may partly be explained the multiple homes owned by many living in these boroughs (students living in different parts of the country and indeed the world for significant periods of the year), foreign holidays and the over representation of private schooling of those living in these areas. If this is not the case and unauthorised absence from school is reflecting the unauthorised absence of poorer students attending local, inner city schools, then high GCSE grades may also reflect the achievements of those who are sent away to expensive fee-paying schools elsewhere in the country and who return to their parental homes later in the year. Either way, these factors could explain these results. Of course, these results may not be statistically significant across the whole of London. Roughly speaking, if a coefficient estimate is more than 2 standard errors away from zero, then it is statistically significant. To calculate standard errors, for each variable you can use a formula similar to this: #run the significance test sigTest = abs(gwr.model$SDF$&quot;log.median_house_price_2014.&quot;)-2 * gwr.model$SDF$&quot;log.median_house_price_2014._se&quot; #store significance results LonWardProfiles2 &lt;- LonWardProfiles2 %&gt;% mutate(GWRUnauthSig = sigTest) If this is greater than zero (i.e. the estimate is more than two standard errors away from zero), it is very unlikely that the true value is zero, i.e. it is statistically significant (at nearly the 95% confidence level) You should now calculate these for each variable in your GWR model and See if you can plot them on a map, for example: tm_shape(LonWardProfiles2) + tm_polygons(col = &quot;GWRUnauthSig&quot;, palette = &quot;RdYlBu&quot;) From the results of your GWR exercise, what are you able to conclude about the geographical variation in your explanatory variables when predicting your dependent variable? 9.8 Feedback Was anything that we explained unclear this week or was something really clearlet us know using the feedback form.

Andy Adam6 letters: LSB, DRS. Oh yes! 10.4 Introduction The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) represents the related effects of scale and aggregation on all geographic data and analysis. It was first deomstrated by the geographer Stan Openshaw in 1984 who showed that as you aggregated results to diffrent spatial units the reults could be manipulated to show different outcomes. Throughout this practical book weve considered London boroughs, but would any of the results change if we considered the data at ward level? Are we hiding any trends because we have just used the borough data that summed all of the wards within the borough? Its important to consider what is the most appropraite spatial unit for your analysis and provide appropraite reasoning. Even this is pretty straightforward (e.g. the data was only provided at the borough level) you must contextualise this and describe any potential limitations of it. In this practical i will firstly demonstrate the MAUP in action using some more advanced R code. Then we will have a look at some technqieus to model and validate data. Here we will be using London brough and ward data from practical 1. As were getting better with R, we will try to automate almost everthing  meaning that if you gave this code to someone else they could just run it without any data files and generate the same result. The only thing we wont automate later on is loading an excel file i did find a function online that would let us read it from the interweb but it was more hassle than it was worth. I dont know why the data isnt just also distributed as a .csv. 10.5 MAUP 10.5.1 Get the data Download and unzip the London statistical gis boundaries. # make a temp file to store the .zip in download.file(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;, destfile=&quot;prac10_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;) library(tidyverse) library(fs) listfiles&lt;-dir_info(here::here(&quot;prac10_data&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, &quot;statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(path)%&gt;% pull()%&gt;% #print out the .gz file print()%&gt;% as.character()%&gt;% utils::unzip(exdir=here::here(&quot;prac10_data&quot;)) ## C:/Users/Andy/OneDrive - University College London/Teaching/CASA0005/2020_2021/CASA0005repo/prac10_data/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip Using a recent update we could also change this a bit with the pins() package that downlaods and caches the url and automatically checks for file changes, only re-downloading if needed! library(pins) pinexample&lt;-pin(&quot;https://data.london.gov.uk/download/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london/9ba8c833-6370-4b11-abdc-314aa020d5e0/statistical-gis-boundaries-london.zip&quot;) pins() also lets you share data easily, have a look the RStudio pins blog post for more information.

Ive used a while loop here as when i did my MSc you werent able to put a for loop inside a for loop. I beleive that has now changed but because of that one day i had to spend changing everything i always default to using a while loop. Tell us what a loop is aleady? A loop lets you go over something adding 1 (or any value) each timefor example lets look a basic loop. You need to run everything in the loop at once from the while to the }. If you make just a normal Rscript you can set breakpoints  the code will the stop each time it hits the breakpoint within the loop. You cant do this at the moment with RMarkdown code chunks, i normally develop the loop outside of it looping then put it all together. # set up a variable basicloop &lt;- 1 # so while our variable is less than #6 run the following code within the {} while (basicloop &lt; 6) { #print the varaible (starts at 1) print(basicloop) # then add 1 to the variable basicloop = basicloop+1 # go back to the start of the loop #and if it is still &lt;6 run again } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 That loop outputs the values of 1-5, as we started with a value of 1, then added 1 to make 2. It remained below 6 so the code ran again printing the 2 then added 1 again to make 3 and so on. As we specified less than 6 it stopped there.. We can also save these results to diffrent variables but we need to make a list (or dataframe/ whatever you need) to start with to save them in # here is my empty list emptylist &lt;- list() basicloop &lt;- 1 while (basicloop &lt; 6) { print(basicloop) emptylist[[basicloop]] &lt;- basicloop basicloop &lt;- basicloop+1 } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 Here we are using the varaible basicloop to index our emptylist.. so everytime we add 1 it changes the index value.have a look what i mean emptylist ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 4 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 5 emptylist[[1]] ## [1] 1 emptylist[[2]] ## [1] 2 Right, so how are we going to apply this to our data. We have two .shp files (boroughs and wards) in a list that we want to apply our function to.. Firstly lets set up the length to stop at, make an empty list and a starting point. As our data is in a list we just want the length of that (as a number).. # get the length - add 1 as we are using less than boroughlen&lt;-length(boroughsandwardssf)+1 # empty list hold&lt;-list() # here is our starting point variable i&lt;-1 Now here is the loop.. # while i is less than boroughlength # max of boroughlength is 3 while (i &lt; boroughlen){ # put the output in our varible # use the function for boroughs and then wards hold[[i]] &lt;- Joinfun(Airbnb, boroughsandwardssf[[i]]) # add one to the index i&lt;-i+1 } # make a quick thematic map to have a look justairbnbborough&lt;-hold[[1]]%&gt;% dplyr::select(GSS_CODE, airbnbs)%&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% distinct(GSS_CODE, airbnbs)%&gt;% left_join(boroughsandwardssf[[1]], ., by = c(&quot;GSS_CODE&quot; = &quot;GSS_CODE&quot;)) justairbnward&lt;-hold[[2]]%&gt;% dplyr::select(GSS_CODE, airbnbs)%&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% distinct(GSS_CODE, airbnbs)%&gt;% left_join(boroughsandwardssf[[2]], ., by = c(&quot;GSS_CODE&quot; = &quot;GSS_CODE&quot;)) qtm(justairbnbborough, fill = &quot;airbnbs&quot;) qtm(justairbnward, fill = &quot;airbnbs&quot;) When should i use a loop? Well thats a hard questiongenerally loops used to be considered inefficient in R, but im yet to come across a method that will let you increment one varibale whilst keeping another consistent by this i mean like what we did in our loop. We changed what spatial data was joined with the Airbnb data  the Airbnb data remained the same. There are a few other functions like mapply(), sapply() and tapply() that work in the same format as lapply() but to my knowledge they still will increment all of the variables at the same time. In terms of code clarity im going to refer to section 21.5 on iteration in Wickham $ Grolemund (2017) Some people will tell you to avoid for loops because they are slow. Theyre wrong! (Well at least theyre rather out of date, as for loops havent been slow for many years). The chief benefits of using other functions is not speed, but clarity: they make your code easier to write and to read. That said, within this course you are not marked on how good or efficient your code is. Sure, i want you to write great code, but if you are writing code for your assigment or any future project really, my advice is the same. Get something that works and addresses the mark scheme (read the mark scheme!) and then if you have time, improve it later on. There is also a section later on about writing advanced code in the assignment. 10.5.5 Advanced mapping (again) Right, so we can sort of see the difference between the spatial levels (boroughs and wards) but lets take a closer look within Westminster here is the preamble for the leaflet map basically all the stuff we need to set it up library(classInt) library(leaflet) library(leafpop) # extract only westminster from boroughs Borough &lt;- hold[[1]] %&gt;% filter(NAME==&quot;Westminster&quot;)%&gt;% # we need to set the projection to WGS84 # to use with leaflet st_transform(., crs=4326)%&gt;% #at the moment each airbnb is a row for the borough #we just one one row that has number of airbnbs group_by(., GSS_CODE, NAME)%&gt;% summarise(airbnbs = unique(airbnbs)) wardsatborough &lt;- hold[[2]] %&gt;% filter(BOROUGH==&quot;Westminster&quot;)%&gt;% # we need to set the projection to WGS84 # to use with leaflet st_transform(., crs=4326)%&gt;% #at the moment each airbnb is a row for the wards #we just one one row that has number of airbnbs group_by(., GSS_CODE, NAME)%&gt;% summarise(airbnbs = unique(airbnbs)) # set our breaks for the map breaks1&lt;-classIntervals(hold[[1]]$airbnbs, n=5, style = &quot;quantile&quot;) breaks2&lt;-classIntervals(wardsatborough$airbnbs, n=5, style = &quot;quantile&quot;) # use the breaks to set our colour palettes pal &lt;- colorBin(palette = &quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain=hold[[1]]$airbnbs, bins=breaks1$brks) pal2 &lt;- colorBin(palette = &quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain=wardsatborough$airbnbs, bins=breaks2$brks) # we want a popup of information too # here we make a new varaible with no #spatial info (remove geometry) wardinfo &lt;-wardsatborough %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::rename(Ward = NAME, Airbnbs = airbnbs)%&gt;% dplyr::select(Ward, Airbnbs)%&gt;% popupTable() boroughinfo &lt;-wardsatborough %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::rename(Borough = NAME, Airbnbs = airbnbs)%&gt;% dplyr::select(Borough, Airbnbs)%&gt;% popupTable() Now lets map it using what we just specified ive added a few more features than were in the Map making practical wardandboroughs&lt;- leaflet() %&gt;% # add basemap options addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite, group = &quot;Toner Lite&quot;) %&gt;% addTiles(group = &quot;OSM&quot;) %&gt;% #add our Borough polygons, linking to the tables we just made addPolygons(data=Borough, color=&quot;white&quot;, weight = 2, opacity = 1, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, popup = boroughinfo, fillColor = ~pal(Borough$airbnbs), group = &quot;Borough&quot;)%&gt;% #add our ward polygons, linking to the tables we just made addPolygons(data=wardsatborough, color=&quot;white&quot;, weight = 2, opacity = 1, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, popup = wardinfo, fillColor = ~pal2(wardsatborough$airbnbs), group = &quot;Wards&quot;)%&gt;% # add a legend for wards addLegend(pal = pal2, values = wardsatborough$airbnbs, group=c(&quot;Wards&quot;), position =&quot;bottomleft&quot;, title =&quot;Accom count&quot;)%&gt;% # add a legend for boroughs addLegend(pal = pal, values = Borough, group=c(&quot;Borough&quot;), title =&quot;Accom count&quot;, position =&quot;bottomleft&quot;)%&gt;% # specify layers control addLayersControl( baseGroups = c(&quot;Toner Lite&quot;, &quot;OSM&quot;), overlayGroups = c(&quot;Borough&quot;, &quot;Wards&quot;), options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))%&gt;% hideGroup(c(&quot;Borough&quot;)) # show us the map wardandboroughs Have a look around the mapWestminster borough uses a scale considering all other London borough values, whilst the ward scale is specific to Westminster. Use the following code to explore the values # range of Airbnbs per ward in Westminster Range&lt;-wardsatborough %&gt;% summarise(Max = max(airbnbs), Min = min (airbnbs)) 10.6 Regression relationships Warning The data used within this practical is purely for demonstration purposes! 10.6.1 Preprocessing In this part of the practical were going to try and model the relationship between the Airbnb counts at ward level and other variables. Our mini investagion here would be to see if its possible to produce a statisitcally valid and rigorous model for predicting Airbnb values at the ward level. This type of analysis might be useful if you had missing or limited data at one spatial level (e.g. wards) but had a more complete dataset at a larger spatial scale (e.g. boroughs). Essentially, were trying to use the data at the borough level to give us an estiamte of the data at the ward level. Obviously this isnt an issue for us here but if you ever use survey data or any kind of count data (e.g. health) if may well be limited to specific areas This section will also show you how to make/ use different regression models in R. Regression aims to find a mathematical equation to predict a value (in this case Airbnb at ward level) from one (or more) predictor variables (e.g. borough data). So well use values of X (borough data) to predict values of Y (ward data) This can be represented with the equation: \\[Y = \\beta_{1} + \\beta_{2} X + \\epsilon\\] Where \\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the intercept (expected value of Y when X=0, also called bias in machine learning), \\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the slope of the line and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, the part that the model is unable to explain (and variables are not included)Here we would call the intercept and slop coefficients. To start with were going to crop our wards data to our boroughs data. In the borough data you can see the river Thames which isnt in the wards data. I dont think this is technically required, but its good practice to make sure you datasets align and if they dont to do something about it library(tmaptools) cropped &lt;- justairbnbborough %&gt;% crop_shape(justairbnward,., polygon = TRUE) # something like this would just extract the # values within the shape, but not clip like a cookie cutter # we want to use the borough layer to cut out the river from # the wards layer ###test &lt;- hold[[2]][hold[[1]],] # check it worked, you should be #able to see the river plot(st_geometry(cropped)) Now we need to join our wards data and borough data togther to give us a borough value for each ward within # join wards and boroughs joined &lt;- justairbnbborough %&gt;% st_join(., justairbnward, join=st_contains)%&gt;% rename(., Boroughcount = airbnbs.x, Wardcount = airbnbs.y) 10.6.2 Scatter plot To start with lets just visualise the relationship between the borough an ward count using a scatter plot. If you have multiple predictor variables (explied later on) a plot will be drawn for each of them p &lt;- ggplot(joined, aes(Boroughcount, Wardcount))+ geom_point()+ xlab(&quot;Borough count&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Ward count&quot;) The scatter plot shows some kind of linear relationship. The point variation around borough count is beacuse for each borough the wards will have a range of valueslike we saw in the interactive mapWestminster borough had a value of 9410 and the wards ranged from 159 to 1215 10.6.3 Outliers Generally any point that is outside 1.5* the interquartile-range (or IQR) is considered an outlier (a data point that differs significantly from all others) and you could use something like the methods here to remove and replace themthe IQR is the distance between the 25th and 75th percentile.. par(mfrow=c(1, 2)) # divide graph area in 2 columns boxplot(joined$Boroughcount, main=&quot;Boroughs&quot;) boxplot(joined$Wardcount, main=&quot;Wards&quot;) Warning The data used within this practical is purely for demonstration purposes! These box plots indicate that our data is not normally distributed so you might want to refer to the assumptions in last weeks practical if you were to do this propperly. 10.6.4 Correlation Correlation lets use see the level of linear dependence between two varaibles between -1 and 1. High values (towards 1) mean that for every x instance there is an increase in y. Low values (towards -1) mean the opposite. library(corrr) Correlation &lt;- joined %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% dplyr::select(Boroughcount, Wardcount)%&gt;% correlate() %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## rowname Boroughcount Wardcount ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Boroughcount NA 0.789 ## 2 Wardcount 0.789 NA Looks, like weve got a strong relationship. 10.6.5 Linear model Now lets use a linear model to establish a relationship between predictor and response with the function lm(). Here we are calling the lm()(then stating the Formula, then the data) library(broom) linearMod &lt;- lm(Wardcount ~ Boroughcount, data=joined) tidy(linearMod) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) -10.9 6.20 -1.76 7.97e- 2 ## 2 Boroughcount 0.0550 0.00182 30.2 2.68e-119 So from this output we have the coefficients of intercept and Boroughcount, going back to our formula from earlier this would mean \\[Wardcount = -3.8188 + 0.0541*Boroughcount\\] 10.6.6 Linear model outputs Coefficient Estimates Our intercept, the expected value of Y when X=0 is -3.8 and slope is 0.054. Standard error The coefficient standard error represents the average amount that coeffieint estimates vary from the average of our response. It basically shows the expected range if we were to model again and again. So here, for a 1% increase in the number of Airbnbs per ward by 0.05, but this might vary by 0.001. Ideally the standard error is lower than the size of the coeffeicient (0.001 is lower the 0.05) p-value A linear model is only statistically significant when both p-values are &lt;0.05 within the summary call. There are two values as one if for the coefficient (is the specific coefficient significant) and the other is for the model (is the model significant). Here as they both are, this would allow us to accept the alternative hypothesis that the coefficients are not equal to 0 (and therefore there is a relationship between the independent and dependent variabile). R-squared R squared represents the proportion of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent. It is different from correlation as that is the strength of the relationship!!! R squared is often referred to as goodness-of-fit. Here 61% of the variance in Airbnb ward count can be explained by the varaition in Airbnb borough count. But there are a few issues with R squared  every time you add a predictor to the model R squared will increase and if there are too many predictors it will model random noise Adjusted R squared Adjusted R squared consideres the number of variables within the model, increasing only if the new term assits by more than just chance. t Coefficient t shows how many standard deviations the coefficient estaimte is away from 0  the further away means the more likely we can reject the null hypothesis. It is calcaulted by dividing the value of the coeffeicient by the standard error Residual error Residual standard error is a measure of the quality of fit of the linear regression line. It is an average of the error that the points differ out from the line. F F-statistcs, basically, the futher from 1 the better it is. See this guide for more information on the outputs Remember the formula produced from the regression equation, well we can also extract this automatically to make that original formula in RMarkdown I used this (not within a code chunk). $$Wardcount = -3.8188 + 0.0541*Boroughcount$$ But we can also extract it directly using a new package from GitHub # load remotes so we can get the new package library(remotes) # get the new package equatiomatic() remotes::install_github(&quot;datalorax/equatiomatic&quot;) # load it library(equatiomatic) # extract the info to make the equation extract_eq(linearMod) ## $$ ## \\text{Wardcount} = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(\\text{Boroughcount}) + \\epsilon ## $$ Play around with line length and use the actual coefficient names extract_eq(linearMod, use_coefs = TRUE, wrap=TRUE, terms_per_line = 2) ## $$ ## \\begin{aligned} ## \\text{Wardcount} &amp;= -10.89 + 0.06(\\text{Boroughcount})\\ + \\\\ ## &amp;\\quad \\epsilon ## \\end{aligned} ## $$ This would produce the following in RMarkdown. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Wardcount} &amp;= -3.82 + 0.05(\\text{Boroughcount})\\ + \\\\ &amp;\\quad \\epsilon \\end{aligned} \\] Have a look here for more information on using equatiomatic(). 10.6.7 Validation Weve made a regression model using all of our data but there is now no way to test its validitywhat if we take 20% as a test sample and use the remaining 80% to train it joinedID &lt;- joined %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% mutate(Wardcount = replace_na(Wardcount, 0))%&gt;% mutate(id = row_number()) # Create training 80% index train &lt;- joinedID %&gt;% sample_frac(.70) # Create test set test &lt;- anti_join(joinedID, train, by = &#39;id&#39;) Now lets build the model # build the model lmMod &lt;- lm(Wardcount ~ Boroughcount, data=train) # use the model to make some predicitons with our test data library(caret) predictions &lt;- lmMod %&gt;% predict(test) # get R2, RMSE and MAE stats&lt;-data.frame(R2 = R2(predictions, test$Wardcount), RMSE = RMSE(predictions, test$Wardcount), MAE = MAE(predictions, test$Wardcount)) t #for some reason this will show in RStudio #but not the bookdown (this practical) output. We can use the R2, Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error. \\(R^2\\) is the variation of y explained by x Mean Absolute Error measures the average magnitude of the errors (distance of points from the regression line) using: \\[MAE = {\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\\Big({d_i -f_i\\Big)}}}\\] Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the resuiduals, this means how far away the points are from the regression line \\[RMSE= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\\Big({d_i -f_i}\\Big)^2}}\\] Where \\(d_i\\) is the actual value, \\(d_f\\) is the predicted value, and \\(n\\) is the number of data points We could also just run a correlation between the data we left out and the predicted data to assess the accuracy actuals_preds &lt;- data.frame(cbind(actuals=test$Wardcount, predicteds=predictions)) actuals_preds_correlation &lt;- actuals_preds %&gt;% correlate() %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## rowname actuals predicteds ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 actuals NA 0.776 ## 2 predicteds 0.776 NA This shows us that we have a strong and significant relationship between our model output and the test data. We can also use min-max accuracy to see how close the actual and predicted values areusing the equation \\[MinMaxAccuracy= mean\\left( \\frac{min(actuals, predicteds}{max(actuals, predicteds)} \\right)\\] min_max_accuracy &lt;- mean(apply(actuals_preds, 1, min, na.rm=TRUE) / apply(actuals_preds, 1, max, na.rm=TRUE)) min_max_accuracy ## [1] 0.5168844 This gives around a 60% accuracyanother alternative is mean absolute percentage deviation which is a statistical measure showing how accurate the prediciton wasthrough the equation \\[MAPE= mean\\left( \\frac{abs(predicteds - actuals}{actuals} \\right)\\] mape &lt;- mean(abs((actuals_preds$predicteds - actuals_preds$actuals))/ actuals_preds$actuals, na.rm=TRUE) mape ## [1] Inf Here weve got a very high MAPE  this is most likely because of the range of values of the wards for individual boroughs 10.6.8 Cross validation Our validation approach so far was OK, but what if the test data was a different 20%  would it still hold up? We can test this by dividing all our data into blocks and then running the analysis several times, each time selecting a different block to be the test datathis is called cross validation  To start with well remove the geomtery, set up a data frame and replace any NAs with 0  this is appropraite here as if there are no Airbnbs within the ward they would be 0. joined_CV &lt;- joined %&gt;% st_drop_geometry()%&gt;% mutate(Wardcount = replace_na(Wardcount, 0)) Now lets change our training data here ive got 5 iterations then the whole lot is repeated 3 times.

Note that whilst i have selected variables pretty randomly here for demonstration, if you use something like this in practice its important to have supported (referenced) reasoning behind your selections. 10.7.3 Ridge regression Least squares regression tries to minimise how far each point is away from the linebut if you look in this figurethe red dots are the training data and the green dots are the test data. Here normal OLS has been fitted to the training data perfcetlythe sum of the sqaured residuals (squared error distance from the line) is very small, probably 0. But when applied to the test data the sum of the squared residuals is large  it therefore has high variance and would be termed to be overfitting the training data. Figure 10.1: This is a screenshot from the YouTube video Regularization Part 1: Ridge Regression by StatQuest Ridge regression probably wont fit our training data as well, becuase we introduce a small amount of bias (adding value to the intercept  which is the Y value when X=0) to give us less overall variance (the difference between the point and line value)So essentially when the values are calculated the formula is trying to get the line of best fit through all the points with each point having minimum distance to the line. Ridge regression also tries to minimise the sum of the sqaured residuals (distance to the line) but then adds \\(\\lambda\\) x \\(slope^2\\)  this increases the value of Y when X=0. Ok so lets try and look at this with numbers The goal here is to minimise the sum of the sqaured residualsplus the ridge regression penalty \\(\\lambda * slope^2\\) Firstly lets assume you have a perfectly fit line  the sum of the least sqaure residuals would be 0 (the line overlaps the points). Assume \\(\\lambda\\) is 0.5 and the slope is 1.2, we have 0 + 1.44 = 1.44 Now we use ridge regression that shifts the line away from the perfect fit (with a bias penalty) that we had in least square regressionthis would create residual values as the points no longer perfectly fit the line, assume these add to 0.2, \\(\\lambda\\) is 0.5, and the slope is 0.7so this would give 0.445. So if we were trying to minimise the sum of the sqaured residuals plus the ridge regression penatly the ridge regression wins with a lower value. The penatly \\(\\lambda * slope^2\\) adds a bias (value to the intercept) to reduce the slope of the line as it tries to the minimise the sum of the distance of the points from the line and hopefully the variance between the line and the pointslike this  Ridge is the blue line that has become slightly more horizontal Figure 10.2: This is a screenshot from the YouTube video Regularization Part 1: Ridge Regression by StatQuest But wait. how do we calcualte \\(\\lambda\\), well we try a load of values and use cross validation (10 fold) to get the overall lowest variance from the line to the data points! COOL!!!! Lets see an exmaple to show that if \\(\\lambda\\) is 0, then we have our box standard linear regressionas the penalty \\(\\lambda * the slope^2\\) will be 0, so we will just be minimising the sum of the sqaured residuals. library(tidyverse) library(broom) library(glmnet) # sort the data our for ridge regression y &lt;- joined3$Wardcount %&gt;% # set NAs to 0 replace_na(., 0) x &lt;- joined3 %&gt;% dplyr::select(Boroughcount, hotels, population_2015, median_house_price_2014) %&gt;% data.matrix()%&gt;% # set NAs to 0 replace_na(., 0) # set seed means that if we re run this # we will get the same results set.seed(489) # this gives us a 50/50 split between # training and test data train = sample(1:nrow(x), nrow(x)/2) test = (-train) ytest = y[test] xtest =x[test] # run normmal regression normallm &lt;- lm(Wardcount ~ hotels+Boroughcount+population_2015 +median_house_price_2014, data = joined3) summary(normallm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Wardcount ~ hotels + Boroughcount + population_2015 + ## median_house_price_2014, data = joined3) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -334.19 -35.85 -2.95 20.95 721.81 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Lets apply it to the model plot(cv_out) # best value opt_lambda &lt;- cv_out$lambda.min # prediction to the testing data # s is set to optimal lambda # you could also use lambda.1se as # technically they are indistinguishable ridge_pred &lt;- predict(ridge_mod, s = opt_lambda, newx = x[test,]) # rsquared ridge_r &lt;- cor(y[test], ridge_pred)^2 ridge_r ## 1 ## [1,] 0.6543214 # mean square error mean((ridge_pred-ytest)^2) ## [1] 7134.638 You can also doing this in a few less steps with the ridge package 10.7.4 LASSO Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) performs variable selection and regularisation to increase prediction accuracy of the modelthe only difference to ridge is that the regularisation term is an absolute value. So instead of squaring the slope (like i metioned in Ridge regression), we take the absolute value. As a result LASSO regression can increase \\(\\lambda\\) then set irrelevant parameters to 0 (Ridge will just shrink them but not set to 0)  relevant paramters might shink a little bit in both too. The advantage here is that LASSO can exclude useless variables  so if you have a lot of variables it might be preferable. However, if most variables are useful then Ridge regression would probably work better. #find the best lambda from our list via cross-validation cv_out &lt;- cv.glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha = 1, family=&quot;gaussian&quot;, type.measure = &quot;mse&quot;) plot(cv_out) # best value opt_lambda &lt;- cv_out$lambda.min # make the model lasso_mod &lt;- glmnet(x[train,], y[train], alpha = 1, lambda = opt_lambda) # make the prediction lasso_pred &lt;- predict(lasso_mod, s = opt_lambda, newx = x[test,]) # r sqaured LASSO_r &lt;- cor(y[test], lasso_pred)^2 LASSO_r ## 1 ## [1,] 0.6423348 # mean square error mean((lasso_pred-ytest)^2) ## [1] 7588.756 10.7.5 Elastic net regression When you dont know much about our variables in a model you can use Elastic-Net Regression. It starts with least squares then adds the LASSO and ridge regression penatly, allowing you to use the strengths of both. Both the LASSO penatly and ridge penatly get their own \\(\\lambda\\) values, \\(\\lambda_1\\) for LASSO, \\(\\lambda_2\\) for ridge. Cross validation runs for both \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\). If both \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) &gt; 0 then we get a hybrid approach, this is good when we have correlated variables. LASSO will pick just one correlated variable and eliminate the other, whereas ridge will just shrink all of them. Using both LASSO and ridge we can group and shrink correlated variables or remove them all at the same time. In R, Elastic-Net Regression is where you change the alpha value between 0 and 1. You would use elastic net regression to see if it is possible to reduce the mean square error any further. Have a look at this video to see how to use a for loop to test different values for alpha. 10.7.6 Whats the best here Lets compare the results of the MSE and r sqaured for the normallm2, LASSO and Ridge as we used the same predictorsthis is the code to get the values we dont already have summary(normallm2)$r.squared ## [1] 0.6274311 Our lowest MSE and highest R sqaured value here is provided by Ridge regressionso from this anaylsis id select Ridge regression to predict any missing or future values of Airbnbs within the London wardsid probably also conisder exploring using machine learning methods that are linked to below Warning The data used within this practical is purely for demonstration purposes! 10.7.7 What should i use It depends, just because Ridge regression seems to be the best for this application, it might not be for yours. Its important to check the suitability of each method for both your data and analysis. 10.7.8 So how do i predict Easyjust go back through the code and use the the predict() function  this will also work for linear models # replace with your data - this is just an example # setting intervals specifies confidence intervals # at the required level predict(linearmodel, newdata, interval=&quot;confidence&quot;, level=0.95) WARNING Never try and predict data outside the range of your values, for example in the first regression model we ran when the count within Boroughs was 0 we had -3.8188 for Airbnbs within wards and its impossible to have negative Airbnbs. 10.7.9 Should i write advanced code It would be great if you could write your analysis in as least possible lines of code as possibleBUT you are not marked on how concise or efficient your code is in this course. My advice would be to get something that works and addresses all of the marking criteria and listen to Hadley Wickham. The only way to write good code is to write tons of shitty code first. Feeling shame about bad code stops you from getting to good code  Hadley Wickham ((???))

(2000) 11.12 Free flow diagram tools PowerPoint (from UCL software site) Draw.io Lucidchart R Package DiagrammeR Free at the time of writing 11.13 Basics Here are some tips based on common marker comments of how to write a decent assingment Dont cut and paste maps / figures / formulas / tables, export them properly or remake them nicely and credit a source somewhere such as the figure caption (e.g. source Smith et al. 2009 or adapted from Smith et al. 2009). Make maps and figures the right way  dont just leave layer names (e.g. osm_points_road) in a legend, rename them to something with meaning! If you use a formula write it properly  dont cut and paste, fully explain all the symbols / variables too. Make sure you write a sufficient caption for figures / maps / flow diagrams / tables. The reader should be able to understand them without any other information. In other words, if you gave someone a figure with just the caption they should be able to tell you what it shows. Dont bullet point methods, summarise with sentances and use a flow diagram if appropraite. Here is a quick guide to writing a report 11.13.1 Introduction Make sure you say why your mini investiation is important near the start why should we care! Try to answer the so what question. The introduction should set the scene and introduce the reader to issue (what is the background to it), its importance (so what?) and lead onto outlining the research question of the study. 11.13.2 Literature review The literature review should evaluate exisiting research, demonstrate contrasting and/or similar views whilst highlight research gaps (that hopefully your research will contribute to / address). This could also include policy documents or documents from reputable soruces (e.g. UN / EU / authoritative bodies). Wikepedia is not a valid academic source and please dont just list what authors have done in the past (e.g. Smith 2009 did x but Jones 2008 did y then Frank 2010 did x). Synthesise previous work / policy documents and provide a narrative through it whilst trying to show where the research gap is / where you question fits in. Try to end the literature review with a concluding paragraph that concisely summarises everything within it and states what your work is going to contribute or address. Think of this section as providing a story to what everyone else has done (whilst also showing issues / reseach gaps) then at then end BAMMM this is what you are going to do. 11.13.3 Methodology Methodology is what you did (analysis, data processing, data cleaning, etc), a reader should be able to replicate your analysis but you dont need excessive detail  you do not need to list every tool you used. For example, data was loaded uisng read_csv() and then reprojected using st_transform() is too much information for the assignment (you could include this type of information in the comments of your code / RMarkdown document). 11.13.4 Results Results is what you found  be selective about figures you include and provide. To do so ask yourself what does this contribute to my research / aim / objective to see if you need it. Please provide a narrative that guides the reader through your findings, dont just present result after result after result after result. 11.13.5 Discussion Discussion should have lots of critical reflectionby that i mean how do your results fit in with and then advance the ideas presented by others either in academic or policy literature. Really say why this is important with appropriate referencing. 11.13.6 Conclusion Your conclusion should restate what you set out to investigate, summarise how you acheived it, what your results showed, why it is important and in this case specify recommendations (e.g. what should be changed or altered to fix the issue / question you explored). Do not add any new material in this section (e.g. talk about new ideas or add new references). Whilst it seems like ive listed a lot of things to inlcude it short be relatively short  a concise summary. "]]
